Dearest mother,

Well I am sorry that I have not gotten around to writing you news often but will try to do better from now on. I have been receiving your letters rather regular lately and am sure glad to receive them. In Pauline's last letter she said OL was in the hospital in France with yellow jaundice. I hope he is lucky enough to get to stay over there instead of coming of [check] here.

I have received a few letters from Ora Mae and Amy lately but have not had time to answer their letters yet though.

I was glad to hear Wanda did so good in her class and I guess she was proud to receive the scholarship to A.C.C.

Tell the family hello for me and that I think of them often and will be glad when I can see them again.

Lots of Love
Paul
