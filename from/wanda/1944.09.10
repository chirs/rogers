Dearest O.L.

My! What familiar paper. I've gone to school one whole week and I sure do like it. I'm taking English IV, Chemistry, Bookkeeping and Shorthand. Mrs. Robinson said that if I did as well as you did in shorthand that I would be a good student. Imagine that. She didn't say anything about bookkeeping. The Senior class went to the fair at Abilene last Friday night. We had lots of fun but everything cost so doggoned much. 25c for the ferris wheel + everything like that. Too bad that I didn't have a boyfriend there.

Why don't you cuss Son out for not bringing you home. I think I'd like to see you bad enough to give you a big hug when you get here. Don't let him run off from you next weekend.

Amy spent the night with us last night and she really gave us a laugh. Virgie Nell is sick, has been since yesterday morning, but she's better now. Virge vomited and Mother + Daddy got up to see after her when Amy got up (in her sleep) and came in where Daddy was in his shorts and said "Oh excuse me" and ran back in the other room saying "How can I get out of here?" Mother said "You don't, you go back to bed" and Amy did.

We really teased her this morning, especially about seeing Daddy in his shorts + saying "excuse me".

I haven't seen Corky since last Sunday. I think he has been working over at Hiram's. he wasn't even at Sunday School this evening. He didn't like it much cause I started to school at Clyde but I guess he'll get used to it.

Why don't you write to Madeline? She'd be tickled to death to hear from you + you could just let her know you were writing to her as a friend.

Amy Faye is sick today I think she has heart - trouble or something. 

I have the job of cleaning up the school house every Sunday morning now and I guess it's a real job all the time but this morning, oh. It hadn't been cleaned up since we had the all-day dinner last Sunday and was it a mess. I rubbed three blisters on my hand cleaning it up.

Well it's not long till BYPW so I better quit.

Bye + be good + write + I hope I see you next Sunday.

Love,
Wanda

Mon. Morn.

Dear OL - Intended trying to write but feel terrible this A.M. and had to lay down before I finished the dishes. Any way I didn't know any news. Sure wish you could have come home with Son. He thinks you both may get to come next Sun. Hope so. Will write soon if I can get to feeling better. Love, Mother
