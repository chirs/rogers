Dearest Mother + All

Well I got a whole slug of those letters you wrote from Jan 12 on. I also got a letter from Wanda but what surprised me was the nice long letter from daddy too. However I'm glad to hear from all of you. I haven't recd. a letter from anyone except you all. Pauline, Pauline + one from Aunt Sister.

I'm glad to hear that that package is on the way. You can send one every time you are not too busy doing something else if you want to. I'm living the life of Riley right now but I don't suppose it will last very long. Last nite we had a couple of barrels of beer + 25 cases of cake for the company + we're still taking it pretty easy. However the last two sunndy days have sure made me homesick. The cloudy weather gives you a a "care for nothing" feeling + everythign can go to hell as far as you're concerned but the sun makes you think of home more. Be good + Send a package when you can.

Love OL
