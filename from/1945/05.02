Dearest Mom + All.

Well I'm back in the hospital for a few days and am afraid that I may not get back with my outfit.

You can let up on writing so many letters + sending packages until I tell you different because I may not get a lot of them.

I wish I could get mail here but I may be back where I belong soon + then I'll be getting it.

I might had better tell you what's the matter with me. Well it's really not much of anything but they've got a name for it. My complection turns dark + I've not got any appetite or I didn't when I came in. However I feel OK now.

I hope all of you are doing fine back home, + I hope that everything is very pleasant back there.

Be good + don't work too hard, don't worry either I'm OK as can be. Love always,
OL
