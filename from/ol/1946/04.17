Dearest Folks:

Well I think that I had better write you a letter tonight before I take off for my furlough to Switzerland. it has been quite a few days since I have written but it has been a heck of a lot longer since I have received any letters. Guess that I am just dropping out of circulation altogether. I did get a letter from Mary Faye though and think that she is having quite a time back there. That was the first letter that I have received in more than two weeks. I just cant imagine what is wrong with the mail. Maybe it will start coming through soon. Hope so anyway.

About my furlough to Switzerland, I am leaving at 1:15 in the morning and will be gone for 7 days. It will be quite a while longer than that before I get back here because there is traveling both ways and it will probably be the first of May before I get back. I hope to have a big stack of letters waiting for me tho when I do get here. I was wishing that I could send something home for Easter, Wanda's birthday and Mothers day but guess I will have to wait and see how things turn out on my furlough, because I know that I wont get back here in time to do anything like that.

It is getting really nice here now. This afternoon we had a nice little shower but the sum [sic] came out right afterward and it is still pretty warm. The weather stays at more of a medium over here than at home. Just the same I think I could put up with the weather and the rest of the discomforts if I were back there. If they lower the months of overseas service to two and a half months less than what was planned, I may be getting home by the last of july instead of August or September. I will just have to bide my time here tho until they decide which way they want to turn. There have been about a couple dozen fellows here for the last two weeks just looking to go home every day but haven't gotten their orders so far. They will probably be gone when I get back here though.

I am sure being awful extravagant am I not. Going on this furlough when I could do so much with the hundred dollars back there. It is the only chance I have gotten to go there and I don't want to passit [sic] up if I can help it. I even had to borrow some money to get to take it. Guess I will know whether I was doing the right thing or not about five years from now when I am either down in the rut or someplace else. Hope it is the "someplace else." 

I am still planning to go to school when I get back there but don't know exactly what I want to do when I get out. If you could plan it all out ahead of time it would be real easy but that wouldn't be living then. You just have to take it as it comes along.

How are all getting along these days. Hope that you are able to kick as much as I do, there isn't anything that goes your own way anymore. there was an accident over here the other night with four people killed and another one expecting to kick the bucket just anytime. The vehicle they were driving ran into one of our boys and I have just been wondering if they will have him charged with man-slauter [sic] or what. He is just a kid with no parents and I sure hate to see anything charged against him. guess that if they do that he will spend the rest of his time in the clink. I believe that they are not going to make it too hard because the other vehicle was driving drunk, exceeding the speed limits and a few more minor offences which are all in favor of our man.

I took a nice little trip to Nurnberg last wekend [sic] and had a fairly nice time. Went down with one of my budies and visited his cousin that was in the air corps. Got lost a couple of times coming back but finally got in here. The country is real nice now that spring is here and I even enjoyed the trip both ways.

Well guess I had better close for this time. Be good and write when you can.

Love Always, O.L.. .
