Dearest Folks,

I think it is about time I was writing to you again. but I haven't recieved any letters since the last bunch that I answered + with every thing going on it is kind of hard to get out of the cot + answer a few letters that haven't reached you yet. I spend plenty of my time doing things that I could pass up but just don't have the will power.

I was pretty lucky at the P.X. raffle this week, I won a nice fountain pen + a cigarette lighter. Don't suppose I will be quite so lucky next time tho. We get plenty of rations now, In fact too many so guess I shouldn't be worrying.

By the way did Wanda ever get the bracelet? I sure hope it didn't get lost in the mail. It was a fairly nice bracelet + would sure be a nice souvenir from over here.

I guess Brutus is home by now, that is unless he re-enlisted + I don't think he would any think like that.

What is Son doing now? I guess he has already moved hasn't he? Is he too far for you to get to see him ever few weeks? I would think that if he isn't too far from home that he would come down over the week, or month ends. Guess that he doesn't though.

I got a letter from Aunt Beuna + she seemed all in a turmoil because of the public land that was being released by the government for filing, I think she would be willing to stake herself a claim. I guess that would be a good way to get started but guess I'll never be a farmer or rancher.

How are all of you making out these days, Hope your weather has been as pleasant as we had last week, nice sunny weather + really warm, but today + yesterday we have had clouds + a little rain so guess there will be a little dark weather before the summer really gets here.

Guess I'd better close for now, be good + write when you can.

Love always,
O.L.
