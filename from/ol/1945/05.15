Dearest Folks,

Well I got out of isolation today + am now in rehabilitation. I guess I'll be on my way back to my outfit in about a couple of weeks or so now. This trip to the hospital is sure to screw the mail situation up.

The country is fairly pretty over here everything is green + it looks from here like the farmers are working in the fields, Ever thing seems so peaceful.

There is supposed to be a show in about 15 minutes + I think I'll go + see what one looks like. It's been about three months since I've seen one I think.

Well it's about time so I'll finish this when I get back.

The show didn't seem as tho it would be any good so I decided not to stay.

Where is Son at now? or have you heard from him lately?

I don't have any news to tell so I might as well close. Be good + don't work too hard.

Love always
O.L.

Dearest Folks

Well today is just another day but it sure has been hot. It's after 7 PM now + is still plenty warm. The sun doesn't go down until about 9 tho.

There's a sty coming on my eye now + it sure is sore. I don't know what will be ailing me next.

I wish I could hear something about Son, it's been so long since I've heard that I don't even halfway know what the score is. The last letter I got from home was quite a while back too. It was while we were on the Elbe river at a little town.

What is everyone doing back home now? Where is Fey, W.L., G.W., Dudley + all of htose Midway boys at now? I suppose they are all fairly well scattered over the globe arne't they? I hope we're all home son.

How are all the folks now. I guess you are up to your ears in work, as you usually are this time of the year. I hope you get bigger dividends than last year. I guess I must have changed a lot since I've been over here because almost every situation I look at now is a lot different than it was about a month ago.

Well it's just about bedtime so I'll close for now.

Don't work too hard + be sure to tell me all the news the next letter.

Love always
O.L.
