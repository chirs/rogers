Dear Mom + all

Here I was just ready to write a letter home + what do you know, they brought a couple in. One is from you dated apr. 10 + one is from Corky dated the 13. The mail is getting to where it gets here pretty quick now.

You said you had had one of those sick spells again, well mom you're worrying too much just take life easy for a few days + you will feel a lot better.

Corky was telling about an ice cream supper he was to go to. I wish there was some of that stuff over here. I'm just about to get sick of these rations.

I hope that you have a very happy day on May 13 mom + wish I was there to give you a big hug.

Be good + keep the fires burning. O yes I might as well request another box.

Love always
O.L.
