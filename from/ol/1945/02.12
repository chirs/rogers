Dear Mom

Will try to write a few lines today. My head + neck hurt so bad that I can hardly think, so I don't know what it will sound like.

We have been doing a little exercise these last two days + I'm so sore I can hardly get around.

The weather here last nite + today is kind of like those cloudy misty days at home. The ice is melting + it's really sloppy outside.

Last night I went to the theater, "Conflict" with Humphery Bogart was showing it's the first show I've seen since I left home.

It's been so long since I've heard from home it seems like I'm clear on the other side of the world, but I'm only a few thousand miles imagine.

Well I'll sign off. Write when you have time.

Love
     O.L.
