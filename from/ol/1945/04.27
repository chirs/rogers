Dear Mom + all

Well it's been a couple of days since I've heard from you. I got a letter from Pauline today dated the 15 + she said that she hadn't heard from Son in about two weeks. I hope he's doing OK now.

Pauline sent me the clippings of the Brock [?] event + I guess Wanda + Madeline are pretty proud of themselves. However Clyde should have had some of its ex'es back to help them out.

I'm supposed to wash my field jacket today + they may let some of us go to a USO show that they are supposed to have around here somewhere.

I suppose by now our outfit should be making the paper back home so you may be reading about me now.

Be good + write every day. Love
O.L.
