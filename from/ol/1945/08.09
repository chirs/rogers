Dearest folks

Well I guess I'll be shipped out before too long. The 'rumor' came down today that we would all be out of the 69th before the end of aug.

This is a heck of an anniversary. Exactly one year ago today I went into the army + I've already spent more time overseas than I did in camp in the states.

I got two nice long letters from you + Wanda yesterday. They make me a little homesick at times.

You told all about the boys in the service from home but you didn't even mention Son. Where is he now + how is he getting along.

Hope like hell to see you soon ('doubtful'

Love always O.L.
