Dear Mom;

Here it is Sunday nite + I'm still here. A lot of the boys are getting passes tonite but theres nothing to do in town so I'll stay in + write a letter or two.

I've got a detail for tomorrow so I guess I'll have to get on the ball for a change. I haven't done a thing since I left home except work K.P. for 1 day.

Say mom when I get my other address you can send me a big box of candy "chocolate fudge" + if you want to you can send some cookies along with it. Don't send it to this return address because it's not much telling when it would catch up with me.

How did my pictures look? Don't set one up in the garden it may even keep the seed from coming up.

I will probably be sending most of my pay home because our rations cost us very little + I would only gamble the rest of it off.

Did Pauline get their car out of Mineral Wells? I guess they've moved out at Homer's now haven't they?

Is everything Getting along OK at home? Has the check came through yet? Has daddy got rid of his peanuts yet? If you ever need any money let me know. I can do something about it. I think.

What's Virgie + Joe doing now? I may be able to send home a package if I ever find something of interest.

I'll have to close now so write real often. I'll keep you fairly well posted so you don't have to worry none. 

Love
O.L.
