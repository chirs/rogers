In Germany

Dearest Mom Dad + All

I got another bundle of those letters "24" So I'll have to write at least one in reply.

There's a big rumor going around that the 69th is going to be done away with. If you've got so many points you stay over here for occupation if you haven't you go to the South Pacific, I haven't got "So Many".

You were worrying about Son not writing, well I wrote him a couple of letters + told him how it was. It is pretty hard to get writing material sometimes tho + that may account for some of his negligence. Don't let Pauline talk you out of sending him packages etc. If you get the chance to send it. If he's up front very long periods at a time he'll appreciate any thing almost.

Well so Wanda + Corky had a little misunderstanding huh, I don't know what to think about that. I guess things are running pretty smooth now tho.

That seems pretty bad about Corky's nite [?] I guess it is just one of those things tho maybe it will help to keep him from getting a good start in the army.

Well Daddy how are the crops coming along now? Do you have any more cows, or any thing new? Boy they sure have nice grain crops over here, better than any I've ever seen back home anywhere.

They sure do work on this land tho. They have only small plots but they sure do make them look good.

There sure has been lots of wet weather here lately, it rained so much today that we just stayed in the house + did nothing except pull our guard.

We are supposed to be out of here by the 1st of next month. I don't know where we will end up at, but a lot of us are going to the 29th Div. + the rest will be sent elsewhere.

It's getting pretty late now so I guess I'd better close for the time being.

I hope to see you soon but don't count on it too hard. I'll sure be glad to see Virgie, Joe + the rest.

Love Always
O.L.
