Dearest Folks;

Well this is Sunday and there isn't too much to do, I thought I would try to write on this thing but it is not so easy as on an American typewriter, as you can probablz [sic] see. Boy last night was really cold, I guess I was luckz [sic] that I wasn't on guard. This morning we moved over here in the house and I suppose it will be a little warmer than the thing that we were in,However we dont have any kind of heater in our room and I suppose it wont be any too warm on the cold winter days that we will soon be having,

We have quite a few movies here and I think I see my share of them,  I saw about five this past week, Most of them are just the straight run but I thgouth two of them were prettz [sic] god. It's a pitz [sic] I don't trink, thez [sic] have lots of beer,wine  cognac, etc From looking at some of the boys I don't care too much about it tho.

Ever day there are men leaving out to go home they all have over 75 points though and I will have to collect quite a few before I have that many, , I guess by now you have decided that I have quite a while more over here, I am about to think the same thing, There are not even anz [sic] more rumors now,

I got a letter from Pauline the other day and it seemed as tho Son hadn't moved from where he had last ben, I hope he gets to get home before too long. I soppose he is in about the same situation aas me though, That letter is the only one that I have received since I've been here maybe I'll start getting more before too long.

I guess bz [sic] now you can see that the Y isn't in the right place and that the Z has just about took its place. Thez [sic] are just backwards on this thing.

I guess school is well on it's way now, how does it leave you? How are the crops and things going to turn out this year? I soppose that if you have much work to do this fall that you are prettz [sic] busy these days How is everything back there now? Does the end of the war make much of a change or not? I'll bet it is reallz [sic] hard on a lot of the people but I hope that it doesn't effect you too much in that way.

Well gee I've said just about all I know I'll try to write a little more next time if there's any thing to write about, such stuff is hard to find out around here though. Im still trzing [sic] to learn the parts of an automobile, reckon I can?

Bze [sic] for now

Love always
