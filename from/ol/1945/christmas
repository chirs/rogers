[This is a Christmas card, presumably from 1945.]

[postcard text]

To send season's greetings
  from overseas,
You don't have to be
  a hero.
It's merely 'cuz our points 
  don't please.
We still need six ---
  plus zero.
So from this land
  called ETO
We send a holiday
  greeting.
A toast to you 
  from a GI Joe,
"Here's to an early
  meeting!"

[Papa]

Love always
Your Little boy
