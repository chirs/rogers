May - 30 - 45
In France

Dearest Mom Dad + all

Well am now out of the hospital + having to sweat out one of these Repl. Depots.  Just as soon as we move into tents it starts raining like everything + now it's pretty muddy.

The food here isn't near so good as it was back at the hospital but that's expected. The setup here would be ok if there were only about half as many men. However this is just an overnight stop. We will be gone in less than a week.

I still don't know where my outfit is or when I'll get back there but I'm to be shipped back to my outfit as soon as I get out of here. I wish I knew whether they were going to be going by home [here?] or not.

We went up + had our points counted up + I've got the large sum of 23. Only about 4 more years + I may get out. I've only got a couple of battle stars besides time tho.

Gee it would sure seem queer to be back where you could do a few things that you wanted to yourself without someone telling you what + what not to do.

I would sure like to hear from Son. Where is he now! Can he tell you near where he is or not? When you write again send it to my old address + I will get it quicker I think.

What is everyone at home doing now? I suppose you are having to work as hard as ever. If I could get out of here I could probably help you, but you know the circumstances. How is the garden + crop coming along? There are quite a few gardens over here but you don't see any fields of stuff, they are all small plots of ground seldom taking up one acre.

How are all the Midway folks now? Are you having many socials at the church house now? I guess you still have your services each Sunday aft. don't you?

Tell everyone hello for me + that I'm getting along O.K. + Wanda now that school is out you can write a little more often.

Love to all of you.
O.L.
