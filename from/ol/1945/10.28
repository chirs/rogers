Dear Mother and all;

Well today I was lucky enough to gte a couple of letters from home. You mentioned almost everthing [sic] but I wuld still like to know if you did or if you didn't get those money orders that I sent home?

You were worried about Pauline getting more letters from me than you were, I don't think she should be. I have written at least five times as many home as to any place else. I guess that you will have to wait a little while for them.

That sure is bad about Wanda being so puny all the time that she isn't abl to even start college. I guess she will be alright won't she

I shure [sic] hope that those peanuts turn out as good as you think they will. I guess that is about all that you will be getting any money on this year isn't it?

Tonight is the time to go on guard again so since you mentioned something about me telling the travels I have been through since I left Ft. Meade I guess I might as well, However it may take quite a few pages to put allof it on.

"Autobiography"

Well while we were at Ft. Meade we were so busy getting clothes and everthing [sic] fixed up that we didn't even have tie to sleep through a night without being disturbed. Let alone get a pass to one of the near towns.

We moved from Ft. Meade to Ft. Miles Standish. We stayed there for a few days, doing nothing and then one afternoon we got on the train that took us to the "Ille de France". This was on the 5th of Jan. We got on the boat then and a couple of days later we pulled out. We were on the water about a week and the first two days I was out I was the sickest I guess that I ever got.

When we were about whin sight of Eng. there was a couple of escorts that intercepted us. There was supposed to have been a nazi sub in the vicinity that night so we cut the motors for about four hours and the next morning we went on into the bay. about a couple of days after that we went on land at Glasgow, got directly on the train there and it took us almost twenty four hours to go across England. We came into Southampton the next aft. around six. We got off the train and went directly to a little boat named the Lance.

A couple of days later we were landing on the French coast in landing barges. It was already dark and really cold. We stayed in the remains of LeHavre until about four in the morn and then went out to the repple depple outside of the town. We stayed here for breakfast and then pulled out for the railway station.

Today we were to get out first rides in the box cares. We traveled clear across France to the town of Givet. This was a replacement depot that was only a few miles from the front end and here we saw our first German planes. Mostly Recon.

We were at Givet for about a week and here we zero'd in our rifles and took some of the basic training over. When we left we went to the 69th Div. at a little town that we called tent city because we lived in tents and they so outnumbered the houses there that it was pitiful.

After we left tent city we went into Belguim [sic] and had a few more days of sweating before we went up to the lines.

On Feb. 11 we were commited to the lines. Naturally we were really scared to death the first few days we were up there but it wore off after about the first week and we settled down to the job. There were quite a few accidents there a lot of them intentional "I think".  So before we left out of there I guess about a couple of dozen guys that had been with our co. were back in the hospital. I think the officers were no excuse because there was a lot of sickness up there and only the officers went back to that ailment.

The 27th of Feb. around 3 oclock found us up already to do business. We pulled out and before dawn we were in the enemy lines. The hum of business all around made you a little nervous but you decided that you had better not stop now.

There were six towns assigned to the 69th to take and G company wasn't left out. Our objective was the little town of Dickersheid. From the previous recon patrols and all information that G2 sent down there was not supposed to be any resistance at all in here but we found out different pretty quick.

After a nice little skirmish we took the objective. After losint [sic] all of one platoon but one squad and quite a few more men out of the remainder of the company. We found out that the Jerries had sent something close to 125 men with 16 machine guns, mortars, and small arms back in to receive us.

Our squad was a little lucky this time we only lost four men. Two to a sniper and two to artillery.

Outside of the town we dug in and that afternoon we received a counter-attack. It was expected and therefore were prepared for it. The jerries decided they really didn't want to come back. "For some reason"

We stayed in these fox holes for about a week and started out on the trip to Blankenheim. For about a couple of weeks we "took it easy here" Daily training and all that sort of stuff. We were really glad to get out of there. Even if we weren't doing any fighting, We also received some new men in the squad at this time.

When we left this place we were fortunate enough to have trucks to ride in. Our armor was in front of us so there was not too much danger of being bushwhacked.

We went into Kassel without any resistance. We were closing up that pocket."remember"

But the next town after we left Kassel there was some more fun that the army didn't want us to miss. Here we ran into a little town with about thirty soldiers in it. They had a few armored cars and a couple of tanks. In one of these tanks a big general got away. We took over the town with few casualties and the next morning we had about a half dozen hams and lord knows how many eggs for breakfast.

From here we moved out to the next town which was supposed to be taken by the 1st Bn. It was so we again picked up our trucks and started on again. It wasn't too far until we came to the town of Weisenfels. The resistance had became so little by this time that the MP's had decided that they wanted a little glory so they were leading the way in recon cars. When they started into this town there was a ready reception here for them. They pulled back pretty fast and said that they thought it was the Infantrys job here.

For a couple of days here there was a lot that kept us pretty busy. We lost all of our men out of the squad but three of us. We also lost the Plat. leader and the plat Sgt. We were in pretty bad shape but there were sitll [sic] a few towns that the Bn. wanted to take and it seemed that G. Co. got most of the jobs.

About a week later we had just about run out of trouble in that vicinity so we moved on. The next stop was at the Elbe river. at Eilenburg. Here the civilians were even doing fighting but after we gota toehold  in one side of the town we sent out an ultimatum telling the civilians to lay down their arms or we would level the whole town. They didn't see it our way so we did as promised.

We were here with the Jerries on one side of the river and us on the other side and never were getting anything done.

We had been having rations all the time and I hadn't been feeling worth a darn but this morn they had hot chow and I was so sick that I couldn't even down that. I decided that it would be a good idea to go to the medics so I did. I had no idea that they would send me to the hospital and therefore I left all my belongs back at the company. I had no idea of seeing any of the things again but, I fianally [sic] came back. "I think I've told you ov the trip to the hospital.

When I did return to the outfit they were in Laucha, Germany. It was full summer by this time and with the war being over we weren't feeling too bad.

At these places there was nothing of importance except a few accidents which I think I have already covered. From Laucha we came to Hergerhausen and then the outfit went home. We then were sent to Kassel in the Ordinance we still are in.

We weren't special trained in this field so we were only doing odd jobs or helping around with the older men.

After a month at this place we came to the town we are now in. I am still pulling that duty on mp and in a few hours will hae to take another turn at it.

Well that about finishes up the experiences I have been through, Of course I have left out a lot but if I didn't I would probably write a whole book before I finished.

I guess I'll close for now. I am getting a little tired.

Write whenever you have the time.

Love Always
