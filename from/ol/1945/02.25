Germany - 

My own Darling Mom: Well almost another day gone. I am sitting here by the fire + letting the smoke give me my daily beauty bath. The wind has been awful today, It reminds me of the March winds back home.

What do you know, three of us boys up here made a new recipe today for chocolate fudge. We got small amounts of sugar + stuff out of our C rations so we saved up a few meals of it + made a little candy. We had about a couple of table spoons each but what it was sure tasted good. You'll promise to feed me three square meals a day when I get back won't you Mother? I'll probably be a great pest for a good while. 

No mail has came down today so I'll just have to rattle off to finish out the letter. However you may like to hear some of the bull I write.

I sure wish you'd told me all about Son that you have heard so far I'd also like to get his address. He's probably in just about the same position that I am now.

Wanda you write as often as you can + I'll sure answer your letters, tell Corky he'd better write too.

Well daddy how's everything turning up now? Have you broke all the land yet? What are you going to plant this next year? Maybe you should try to raise more chickens, pigs + cows instead of trying to plant a money crop.  However I hope I'm back by harvest time to help you.

Johnny how did you + Bailey to this trapping season? From what I heard, you didn't do so good maybe you'll know more about it next season.

It's just about 12:00 o'clock back there now so I guess you're baking on that cake for dinner yet now [?]. Boy how I miss your good old cooking especially that candy you make ever so often.

I've nothing else to write about so I'll have to close now I guess. How's this for German stationery? huh?

Well be good + all of you write often. I'm still requesting that package. Love always, O.L.
