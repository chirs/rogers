Dearest Folks:

Naturally, since it was on Sunday they decided to move us. We are a lot farther south than we were but as of yet I don't know what the name  of this town is. The place is farily well beat up + looks a lot worse than Butzback did.

Boy! I'm really sore today. We played football yesterday aft. + I think I got a little more exercise than I should have.

I was up until midnight last night but I finally got my laundry.

The buildings we are now in are probably apt. houses once upon a time + they are pretty nice. "At least you have a little privacy" There are only four of us in this room.

I guess I won't be getting any mail for two or three weeks but I'll try to keep writing just the same.

The weather is cloudy + cold. "I wouldn't be surprised to get some snow." 

We passed thorugh a lot of pretty country today but weren't lucky enough to stop in the middle of it.

Love O.L.
