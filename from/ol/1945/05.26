In France


Dearest Folks:

Well I suppose it's about time for another letter so I'll see what I can tell you.

I just got back from a show "Destination." It was pretty good but I am expressed [?] too much by that kind, I'd rather see a comedy.

I think I'm getting out of here Monday + I think I've got a good chance to go home, I hope I'm not disappointed. Another thing I crawled on the scale today + weighed 165 boy it sure surprised me.

How's Virg + Joe these days? I guess I miss them as much as I do any of the others if not more.

I guess I'd better close for today + write Pauline. I haven't wrote her in a long time + I got about 3 or 4 etters from her the week before I came to the hospital.

Will write again tomorrow if I'm not too busy with Physical Exam, etc.

Love aways
O.L.
