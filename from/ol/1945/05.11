Dearest Mom + all

Another Spring day is here, boy it sure is warm of [?] afternoons, I feel so drowsy. just like summer back home.

They are still feeding us real good I suppose I have gained about 5 pounds in the last 3 days.

I've been reading just about all day + have ran out of magazines so I guess I'll have to take a nap when I finish this letter.

I don't have any news to tell as I am in the same room all the time + can't get out to find what is going on around.

How is everything at home now? Tell me about all the things that are going on around there now. You can also tell me the latest news on the boys in service, I never hear from any of them here lately, about a month ago I heard from Brutus. But that's all.

What are all the kids doing now that school is out? I guess they are glad to get to stay at home aren't they?

Well I can't think of anything else to say so I'll close for today. I'll write again soon + I may have a little more to say.

Love
    O.L.
