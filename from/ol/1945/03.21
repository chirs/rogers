My Darling Mother + all,

I recieved your letter this eve + as usual was very glad. I like to hear all the news back home of the things you are all doing but don't tempt me too much.

Yes mother a boy like me with such a dear old mom like you is real lucky. Tho don't worry too much just pray each day as I do + God will speed the day of my return.

That was too bad about the small amount of money dad got for his peanuts. If you can buy about 4 or 500 baby chicks I think I'll be able to finance them until they are able to pay for themselves. The same goes for some pigs too if you want to.

No, I dn't know Son's address but will be glad to get it + also all the news you get hold of around there.

Make all those letters long + ma God keep you well + Strong.

My deepest Love,
O.L.
