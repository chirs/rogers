Dear MOM + ALL.

Well I guess you've just about decided that I had left the country. Well I have. I'm somewhere in the northern part of France. I don't mean imagine it's coldern hell, yesterday morning it was 19' below. I don't know how I'll take it when I have to live in it altogether. I came through a lot of interesting places since I left the states but we have traveled so continually that I don't get to explore much.

I'm well + feeling ok. This chow over here tastes better than any I ever got back at camp. It must be the cooks that make the difference.

Well I don't have too much time now so I'll close, you can write to the return address until you get a different one. The next address will be permanent, I hope.

Love O.L.

Dearest Mom + all.

I've got a chance to write again today so I'll see what I can find to talk about. There's not much news that I can tell you that would get past the censor, so you will have just [sic] take what I write or else what goes through the censor.

Where is Son at now? Has he already gone to the South Pacific or is he still in Fort Ord? You can send me his address when he gets one that he will have for a while + while you're at it you can send me C.J.'s address too. I may get to see him if I'm assigned to the same outfit as his.

The sun is shining today for the first time. It's not near so cold as it was. How is the weather at home now? I suppose it will be springtime pretty soon. You can start looking for me home about next fall or maybe Xmas. I hope I don't stay over here any longer than that.

I got my American money changed into French francs today + you think as much of it as a piece of blank paper.

You can let me know which form of mail reaches you sooner + I'll try to use that kind when I write.

Be sure to write often.

Love
O.L.
