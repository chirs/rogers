[fragment, on American Red Cross stationery. presumably during hospital stay.]

that I hope to send home if I ever get back to Paris or someplace back there with them. I'll also try to send some souvenirs if I can.

I've at least got one thing from the hospital, that's a clean pair of O.D.'s the last change I had was when I crossed the Rhine. We swiped new pants + shirts from a negro Q.M. outfit + boy they really got mad.

I'm just about ready to go home now but I guess we will have to help big brother out first, any way I'll be home before too long.

Love
    O.L.
