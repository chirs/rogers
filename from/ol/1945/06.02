In Germany

Dearest Folks.

The reason I haven't wrote in so long is that for about a week here I was traveling + since I've got home I'm alerted to move out any time. But guess I'll have to write or you may forget my address.

The town I'm in now is Halle. My outfit is about 40 miles from here + about noon they are supposed to send some trucks for us. but that's the same way it was yesterday, but the trucks didn't come.

A bunch of the boys from other divisions can't get back because the GO storage [??] is already filled up . I think I'll make it tho.

We had those C rations while we were on the train + I'm not feeling so good from having to eat them. 

I was on go and the first 24 hours I was at this place but since then I've not caught any more details. There will be plenty of work when I get back to the company. I don't care too much about going back. There's only two old boys in my squad. The rest of them were wounded or killed before I left for the hospital. 

The chow isn't too good here but it never is all these replacement companies. The cooks don't care whether the guys eat or not.

Will have to close now.

Write whenever you can.

Love always,
OL
