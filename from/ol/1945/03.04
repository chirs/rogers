My Dearest Mom, Dad + all

Well another day almost gone. I'll have to write a few letters I guess. I haven't written to anyone except you all in quite a while.

The days sure are lonely here, my thoughts are almost all of home, boy am I going to celebrate when I get there. I guess there is really no place like home. Tell Johnnie + Bailey if they aren't any better to their dear old mom + dad then I was that they will really be in for it when I get back home. Tell sweet little Virgie + Jo that I would sure like to have some of the candy that daddy brings home to them. I guess Betty Jane is just about to be getting to be a miss now isn't she. I'll probably think little baby sister is a stranger the next time I see her.

Tell Albna + Lou hello for me + the same to the rest of the neighbors. Write every day if you can.

I'll always Love you.
O.L.
