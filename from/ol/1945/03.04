My Dearest Mom, Dad + all

Well another day almost gone. I'll have to write a few letters I guess. I haven't written to anyone except you all in quite a while.

The days sure are lonely here, my thoughts are almost all of home, boy am I going to celebrate when I get there. I guess there is really no place like home. Tell Johnnie + Bailey if they aren't any better to their dear old mom + dad then I was that they will really be in for it when I get back home. Tell sweet little Virgie + Jo that I would sure like to have some of the candy that daddy brings home to them. I guess Betty Jane is just about to be getting to be a miss now isn't she. I'll probably think little baby sister is a stranger the next time I see her.

Tell Albna + Lou hello for me + the same to the rest of the neighbors. Write every day if you can.

I'll always Love you.
O.L.

Deareset Mom,

Well here it is another day I didn't write yesterday so I thought I'd better write today.

I had a pretty nice breakfast this morning "for a change" or I might should have said enough breakfast. I had fried ham, fried potatoes, a couple of pancakes + an apple, however the ham and potatoes we had to rustle aunselmas [??] I am also setting here eating baked potatoes as I write this letter.

Some of the boys got mail yesterday but I suppose mines still traveling. From the above paragraph you can draw your own conclusion of my asking for a package.

I hope everythings fine at home. How's Pauline, Lynn + Dwight + Son [?]

I'll close for now. Write soon.

I love all of you more everday.
                      O.L.
