Dearest Mom Dad + all

Well I hope to get another letter off to you today. "meaning this one"

I guess it must be spring over here, we hd one of those "April showers" Altho it was a little early. I suppose by now you are getting ready for easter. I think it's supposed to be the first isn't it? I don't even know the day of the week + about half the time I don't even know the date.

There is supposed to be $40.00 on its way to you starting the last of the month. Maybe you can get around to getting Wanda a graduation present out of it. You can do with the rest as you see fit.

Gee I've got a headache. I know it's from wearing that old steel helmet so much but there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe it will be better tomorrow.

Am getting along OK + hope all of you are well + enjoying those nice spring days back home. Was sure expecting a package when I saw the mail clerk bring some up today but guess my name just wasn't on one of them.

Will close + try to write another letter or two. Write every chance you get.

Love
O.L.
