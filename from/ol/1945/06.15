June 15 - 1945
In Germany

Dearest Mom Dad + All

Well I'm finally back to my Company + I get five letters today 3 from home 1 from Pauline + 1 from Mrs. Wilson. They've still got a big stack down at the C.P. but the mail man wasn't there when I went in this eve.

I'm glad to get Son's addresss maybe I can drop him a line or two now. I hope he gives those Japs hell with that machine gun. So he is a "heavy Weapons" Company on Platoon?

I'm a little behind on my pay now, about $75.00 + I'll probably be sending most of that home since the money is not any good to one here.

I was in 3 Repl. Depots, 1 at a little town near Luxembourg the 2nd at Munster, Germany + the 3rd at Halle.

At Munster they had a pretty good deal, that must have been kind of a resort or something. They had race tracks there for horses. The Depot had taken over a large swimming pool. I took a swim there altho it was pretty cold. There was also a big brewery neary.

I hope you've got more chicks by now. From the picture of the food shortage there should be a nice price for almost anything this year. Those canned stuffs sounds good too.

Boy I'll bet I weight almost 20 pounds more than I did before I went to the hospital. You will really have to feed me when I come home.

We're about 20 miles from Leipzig here + it's Russian territory so we will have to move soon more than likely. I'll write again tomorrow.

Love always
O.L.
