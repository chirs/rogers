Dear Mom, Dad + All

I've nothing to do tonight so I'll drop another line home. Today was Sunday and we were off. However I had to do a few things off + on so you see it was just another day. I don't know whether it's a habit over here or not but i've had chicken for Sunday dinner every Sunday I've been over here.

The boil on my jaw is getting better now. I got alot of matter out of it. My throat is still sore, it's not serious tho.

I'm going to try to get you a birthday gift mailed tomorrow, mother, if I can. It ma [sic] beat this letter there tho.

The boys are all in the rear of the tent singing those "old time" songs. It sure makes you homesick. Write as often as you can.

Love
O.L.
