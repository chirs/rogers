Dearest Mom + All

I suppose about now it is almost dinner time at home + since this is Sunday I give it a special thought. I sure wish I could come home on weekends like I did in Basic. "shucks" that wasn't so rough.

I expect to be out of here in about a week + don't know where I'll go from here, I sure hope they transfer me out of the infantry, but that isn't very likely.

We had quite a bit of rain last night + it looks as if it hasn't finished either. It's just like spring back home.

A lot of the boys here are going to get to go back to the States, some will get med. discharges + some will be discharged under the point system, you are glad to see them go but it's pretty hard to know that you're missing out on the thing. I suppose tonight will be the night for the Bacculaurate Ceremony for Wanda's Class won't it? Boy I sure wish I was there.

What's new from home? wish I could drop in on you "unexpected like" + see what's going home, "Boy how I day dream" Ha.

Well I've got to shave so will close.

Write as often as you can.

Love always
O.L.
