Dearest Folks

Well I guess it's about time I was writing a letter. I've been playing around until now + it's already 10:15.

I haven't gotten any mail for the last 3 days until today + I got 1 from Ora Mae.

We had another "review" yesterday + "raffled" off a few more Bronze stars. That's about all some of them amount to + that's not fair for the ones that really earn them.

I still don't know when I'm leaving here, or where I'm going when I do but I would not be the least bit surprised if they shipped me to the Pacific "direct" There [?] shipping a lot more now than they were.

It sure seems like a long time since I've seen home. I hope I don't have to find out how it feels to be away for 2 or 3 years.

I may start taking some kind of lessons. "High school subjects" soon. I don't know how long they will last tho.

How is everything at home now? How are Joe + Virgie getting along? I suppose they will all be famirly well grown up when I get home.

Will have to close now. Write when you're not too busy.

Love always
O.L.
