Dearest Folks

Will drop a line + then go to the show we are having tonite. It's the first show "film" we've had since we came ehre.

We filled out some forms today about education + all that stuff. I may get to go to some kind of school if I stay over here much longer.

I hurt my wrist yesterday while wrasseling + it's still pretty sore. I think I only hurt a muscle tho.

Hope all of you are well + happy. Don't work too hard.

Will quit now + maybe write tomorrow.

Love always
O.L.
