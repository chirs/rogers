Dear folks,

Well I am off right now so will write a line or two.

Today we started our cycle. It was pretty muddy cause it's been raining ever since Sat. Is it raining at home now? I was on K.P. yesterday and my number will be up again about or before next Sun.

Are the crops going to make this year? Have you all headed any more of the maize yet? What about the peanuts?

I am not going to get a pay check until about the first of October but will get $10.00 along the first of Sept. So you see I will need all I will get until Oct. 

I'm really growing an appetite. I can't even get all the grub I want + it's not any too good. So you see how desperate I am. After if I'm still hungry I go down to the PX + get something to eat.

Well I had to go get some equipment just then a gas mask + some tent pegs. I am going to have to get my overcoat + a rifle in a minute so will close so I won't have to stop all of a sudden.

Be sure + write soon cause I don't get much mail.

Love, O.L.
