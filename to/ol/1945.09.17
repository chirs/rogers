Dearest O.L. - 

Here I am lolling around in bed when there is <<so much>> work to do. Hadn't been feeling a bit good for a week so Sat. night I took two pills thinking I would get rid of what was ailing me and really got sick instead. Guess I had been bilious and didn't know it. My head is a lot better this A.M. but my back and right side are still giving me a fit. Had thought sure I would get a big package off to you this a.m. but this sick spell slowed me down. Went to the club Fri. just to get some of that canned fruit cake to send you. They also made some hot tamales. Mrs. Webb wanted me to put in a fruit cake from them. Don't know how many cans I can put in and not make the box weight over 5 lbs. (That is the wt limit), but I'm gonna cram it. Want to put in a can of tamales if I can. Am also sending a watch band, razor, comb, hair oil. Sure hope you get it. I should have had it on the road a long time ago but kept thinking you were about to start home. Maybe they will decide to send you home as soon as I get that box started but if it takes that, well, it is worth a whole bunch of boxes.

Mrs. Griffin got a letter Sat. 7 from Joe from Yokohama, dated Sept. 4. He was just about to get on a plane to go to Manila and said he would see her soon. She said she didn't recognize his handwriting, at all.

She never has got word that he was well, I don't think, and she is afraid he is in a shape that he will have to stay in a hospital. But she says just as soon as he gets to the States she is going to fly to him if he isn't able to come home.

We are having the funniest weather. It is very cold at night and hot during the day. It is dry, too. We need a rain and thought we were going to get one last week but it turned into a norther adn was so cold two or three days.

The peanuts will soon be ready to harvest + Daddy and the boys have already been heading some maize. It is ripening in spots. It will be a week or two before cotton is ready to pick around here close. Maybe the kids will get to go to school another week before they have to start working. 

Wanda has some plans about going to school but I'll let her write you about it.

Lots of love from all of us.
