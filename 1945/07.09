Dearest Mom Dad + all

Well I just got through answering Corky's letter so I'll drop you a few lines. I've got a 4:00 money order here that I'm sending. I turned in some french francs + while I was gone to the hosp. they passed the mark out. I just got a money order.

The last 9 days have been pretty nice. It's pretty cool at nights tho. I'll sure be glad to see what that midway weather is like again tho.

I'm getting a little harder than I was when I went to the hospital. We play ball a lot + have our exercise almost every day.

Today I washed a lt of socks + underwear. I'll have to wash my shirt + pants + iron them soon.

I've ate so much candy the last two days that I've almost made myself sick. I guess I'll have to let up.

Well daddy how's the crops doing? Are you going to have many watermelons. How do you think you will come out at the end of the year?

Will have to close now. Write when you can.

Love always O.L.
