Dearest Mom, Dad + All
Well, I got 9 big letters today + was I glad. I got 1 from g.q. [?], 1 from Corky, 2 from Pauline, 1 from Armye [?] + the rst from you.

This weather is sure apt to get a guy down, for the last few weeks it's rally been pretty but today it's cloudy, [?] + for some reason I just don't feel up to par. Maby [sic] it's because I didn't get enough of those Jerries the last chance I had.

I was sure hoping that Son would not have to go up where all the lead was flying but from all indication that's where he is headed. It's a lot worse over there than what we have to go thru over here - so I hear.

Pauline sent me a picture of Dwight + boy he has really grown. I'll bet he's just about as mean as Lynn tho from the expression on his face. Will close now. Take care of yourself + write often.

Love OL
