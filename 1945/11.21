Dearest Folks:

Just to let you know that I still think of you. I haven't heard from anyone in about three or four days and it is awfully hard to write a letter when you don't get any, as you should very easily know. Anyway I will try to tell you a few things.

I think there is going to be a big thanksgiving here tomorrow because they are even going to give us a holiday. We only have a couple of meals tho. Breakfast and dinner. So I guess that I had better not exert myself too much, As if I did that often.

I think that my room mate is getting in a little trouble these days. He is always doing something that he shouldn't and I guess that he doesn't care. He is worse than Corky.

The company commander is sick today and hasn't been down. He is in bed with a cold. "The poor boy" I think that he is almost like on of those little kids too. He seems like it.

There sure isn't too much news around here these days. I think that everything is plenty dead around here.Worse than back home. We still go to the px and have a few gams of cards but otherwise there is very little to do except go home and go to bed. I think from the way I have been feeling here lately that I should stay there more often. It sure gets drowsy around here, With nothing to do. I almost fall asleep sometimes, but not so far.

I will sure be glad when they decide to pay us again, I am a little down in finances for the time being. I have gotten some money loaned out but I don't think that I will be able to get until payday so I might as well be satisfied with the fifty cents that I have with me now.

How are things back there now? I hope that everything is coming along ok. I am also hoping that . will get to come home sometime the next year. I should but the way they are running things now I am not sure what I will be doing this time next year. I will find out in due time tho.

I read a piece in the paper this morning where they were moving all the faster ships over to the Pacific theater for redeployment but I don't think that will bother me in the least. By the time that they decide to let me out of here. I will, I think be willing to thumb my way home.

How is Mrs. Cook getting along now? When does she think that she will be able to see Raymond or O.J.. And when does she think that Reece will be coming home. I guess that there will be a day. and then we can find out all the questions. You said that I asked so many questions in my last letters that you could hardly answer all of them. Well if I didn't ask qustions there wouldn't be anything to write for.

Are very many of the boys getting their discharges back there now? How many poits does Rae have and when does he think that he will get out. What about all of the other boys, I guess that they are somewhat in the same positions as the rest of us.

Well I think that I had better close for this time. I don't know any more questions to ask so this should just about wind up this one. I will try to Tell you a little more in the next letter that I write.

Be good and write whenever you can. I always like to hear how everything is coming along back there.

Lover Always.
O.L.
