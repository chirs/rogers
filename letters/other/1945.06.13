Dear Mrs. Rogers

I see in todays paper where you have a son Pfc O.L. Rogers in Germany with the 69 Div of the first Army.

We too had a Son in Germany with the 69th Div of the First Army but our Son got killed April 8 near a town Wirtzenhausen Germany on the Wessen River in a big 2 story house where the boys had gone to warm themselves up as the weather was cold + misty. 

Enemy artillery fire turned loose on our boys + our Son was hit with shrapnel in the chest he never knew what hit him + died instantly so we are told. There was one other boy wounded.

We had hoped + prayed for our Sons safe return but it wasn't so

We are simply crushed almost beyond existence over our loss its so awful hard to hear we hope someday God will help us to carry our loss.  Our son was just 19 yrs old he was ^one of the finest boys the U.S.A. had.

We would like very much to know if your Son knew our Son + did he happen to be with him when he gave his life.

Our Sons Address was Pfc. Alfred R. Price  38608417 Hq. So. 3rd Bn 272 Mt. 69 Div. PPo 417 010 Pastenaste New York, NY his Lt. was Lt. John W. Dautzler.

Will you be so kind as to send us your Sons address if he knew our Son we would like so much to see him when he comes home and I hope that won't be too lnog.

I see you have another Son in the Pacific.

May God Bless them both + take care of them + return them home safely.

We'd be so glad to hear from you.

Sincerely yours,
Mr + Mrs. W.R. Price
