Sat. morning

Dear O.L.

Well Boy, how are you getting along, pretty good I guess.  I'm sorry I haven't written you any sooner but I have been busy and I'm home now is the reason I'm writing you.  I just got out of the hospital and am just laying around.  I had the appendicitis, but they didn't operate and I'm being pretty quiet, just laying around.  Have you been shooting any more guns, I bet your having lots of fun.  I don't guess I'll go back in the service, I wished I was tho.  I think I'm going to start to school at Hardin Simmons this last Semester, I'm going to try to get an education if I can, so I'll be smart like you or the  Hergs [sp?], I don't know who's the smartest (ha) good joke aint it.  I'll bet you wouldn't thought of the Hergs for a dollar.  I saw Carnie yesterday and he's playing football for H.S.  he's on the first team too.  I bet they sure have a good team.  If Carnie is just on the first team, maybe I'll make waterboy when I go.  Carnie is in love, as if he never was. He don't know who he's in love with, but he's in love.  We're the type that don't fall in love, or at least you are.

I was intending to go out to your house that Sunday morning and go a hunting, but Daddy took the car off and I didn't have any way out there but walk and I've walked enough.  Did you go anyhow?  Did you kill anything, I saw 2 squirrels out at our well the other morning but I didn't kill them.  It's just about time that the little squirrels are almost grown, so the next time you come home, we'll go.  I'll be glad when some ducks get on the railroad lake. I'm going to kill them but I'm not going to let some mud hens fool me like they did once before.

Do you remember when we crawled on our hands and knees to kill some ducks and they were mud hens.  It isn't going to happen again.

Well boy, I'm have give out from writing, so I'd better close. Take care of yourself and write real soon.
                                                                       
                                                                                                        An old pal

                                                                                                                         Jim
