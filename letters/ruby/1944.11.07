Dearest O.L. - 

Wanda was so busy last nite she didn't get a letter written to you as she intended. Pauline and Christine brought her home pretty late. The bus didn't run adn the other kids stayed here. It didn't run this mornign either and Daddy took them all to school again. They got the bus out of the ditch yesterday. Guess something else is wrong now.

The Webb boys came by here yesterday going to Griffin's to get some feed and wanted John + Bailey to go. They were pulling the trailer behind the tractor and after they loaded the baled hay, Bill turned the tractor real short and threw off all the boys + part of the hay. The trailer which ran over Joe Donald's leg. The ids didn't know how bad he was hurt but they (Mr. Griffin) took him to the hospital. Sure would like to hear from him this morning. Poor kid. Everything happens to him.

It is clear and still this morning and we are hoping it stays this way quite a while.

Will hav to mail this in a hurry. Its nearly time for the postman. Love, Mother

Virgie + Joe are busy writing you but I won't mail it this time. ha!
