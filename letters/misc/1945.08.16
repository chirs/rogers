Dearest Roy Beth,

It was a rough war wasn't it? I can honestly say that this was the roughest war I was ever in. The grand news came to me as quite the surprise. You see I was just returning from a mission and listening to the radio when I heard the news that the Japs had surrendered. We had bombed a target just about 50 miles north of Tokyo only about two hours before the news came over. I naturally thought about my quart of whiskey that I had in my footlocker right away and so when I got back here I kissed the red cross girls who were waiting for us with thier [sic] coffee and doughnuts and then proceeded to the officer's club and got stinko. We had the band at the officer's club the last I remember and everybody tells me that I had a big time. Oh well, I'm paying for it today and so is life.

Seriously speaking, this is just too good to be true. I've often tried to visualize how it would be not to be in a war and now that it's here I feel a great deal different than I ever thought I would. When I came over here I came with the finest bunch of fellows that I have ever known. The thing that hurts the most is the fact that there are a great many of those guys who won't be going home with me. That is the thing that has been on my mind constantly these past two days. I hope that there is a lot of them in prison camps but I doubt that very much. Anyway we will know before long. There just isn't any way of explaining the feeling you get when you come in from a mission and find that one of your best friends didn't get back. You know a couple of fellows that have gone down recently but I can't mention thier [sic] names until I'm sure thier [sic] closest of kin have been notified.

They haven't told us anything about our future plans yet so none of us know when we are coming home. I honestly don't believe it will be long before they start shipping some of us back to the states. Due to my length of service I'm on a pretty high priorty [sic] but I'm not planning on anything yet.

I got a letter from Pallie Brown today and she tells me that Bob Johnson is expected home anyday now. I'm afraid if he lands in New York, which is natural, that he won't have a chance to come by to see you. I hope he does anyway. If he does tell him I said to go to hell, cause I haven't heard from him since I've been here. If you don't see him I'll tell him myself when I get home.

The fellows here on Guam are taking everything pretty easy. The one thing that's troubling all of us is 'WHEN ARE WE GOING HOME and when that's settled there won't be any more worry.

Well sug, there just isn't any news so I'll say so long for now. Write me and tell me all about the news and especially about you.

Love ya, 

W????
