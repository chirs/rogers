Dearest Folks:

Well just another note to let you know that I got a letter from you today. It was one of those old ones and wasn't much news in it. Was dated the 18 of December and I think that all of you were pretty sick at that time. I have gotten a few since then and I am sure that mostof [sic] you are a lot better than you were at that time. At least I hope it holds up.

I have been feeling pretty punk these last few days but I think that I can say I don't feel so bad now. I think that when this cold weather is gone that I will be a lot better off. Some of the fellows even think that when summer gets here that we will be on our way home, I am still a little pessimistic about that but I guess that it could be possible.

I haven't done a thing today. I think that I made out the Guard roster this morning but outside of that I haven't done a thing for the orderly room. We have got a new Company Commander in today and He is a pretty old man, I think that he is going to be a pretty good Joe but he has been in the army for almost 20 years and you don't know what to expect next. The officers that have been here are going back home in the very near future and after that the older men in the outfit are going back. I think that within six more weeks there will not be too many of these men still here. and then is the time that we will have to take over the whole works of the outfit unless they ship some more men in here pretty quick.

I guess that by now you have gotten word that Son is coming in. I would think that he should be out of here before the next two months. The redeployment is quite a bit in advance of this over here. Or at least that is what the paper states. I hink [sic] that they are going to pick this up over here pretty soon and I heard over the radio that they will be ending the redeployment, or de-mobilization by the first of September. If that is so I should be getting out of here somewhere between now and the first of August, I wouldn't even have to put in my two years if that is so.

I don't kn w whern [sic] I am ever going to get those pictures ready to end [sic] home but I think that I am going to have to get some reprints made before I will want to send them. I don't know what you will think of them but a few of them are pretty good. I also have quite a few of the boys pictures in there and you can get some kind of an idea of what the company is made of.

What is everyone doing back there these days? I guess that everything is running about as usual isn't it? I hope that you are getting some of the things done around there that you have been planning on for the last few years. Maybe that [check] it wont be too long before something turns up that will help out a lot. Maybe when I get tobe [sic] a big business-man that something like that will turn up.

I guess that Wanda is back from out at Haydens and Grace's place isn't she? How did she like her trip. If you can't get here [sic] to write and tell about it I guess that you will have to tell me what is happening around there. I think that you are just about the only one that I have heard from in quite a while, except maybe Pauline. I have cussed so many of the others out for not writing that I guess they really got mad at me and are not writing any more. Well I can't blame them too much. I don't think I did too much writing while I was back there. However I did a little and I haven't heard from some of them in over a couple of months. Well so much for that, I think that I had better close and let you write a little fora [sic] change 

Be good and be sure to write ever chance that you get.
Love                   O.L.
