Dearest Folks:

Guess that I will write another letter tonight, I got a couple of more of them from you today, and I think that you are all feeling a little better than you have been, although you do say that Virgie is sick. Guess that there is always something that is the matter.

You said that Wanda probably wrote me a long letter the other night, she may have but I haven't gotten it yet, I think that it has been quite a while since I have heard from her. I guess that I will be getting word from her pretty soon.

I'm glad to hear that you got a little money out of the estate for a change, it could be possible that something does come out of that esides the four or five hundred a year, however if that keeps up I think that it will help quite a bit.

I took a little trip up to Backnang today and while I was coming back I took a few pictures, I don't suppose that they will turn out to be any good but you can never tell, the sun wasn't out ut there was quite a bit of snow for a background and I think that they will at least show the shadows on the prints.

It has turned cold around here again and I guess that we will have snow in this part of germany [sic] before the winter is over with. However I think that it has been a lot more pleasant than the part of the winter that I spent over here last year. Small Wonder.

I'm glad to hear that Son is getting out pretty soon, guess that he will be home in time to help you get started on your fried chickens. At least I hope so. I suppose that Rae and some more of the fellows will also be coming withhim [sic]. I guess that I just ain't lucky enough to be going home at this time.

As for me needing any money when I get back to the states, I don't know whether I will be able to take all that I need along with me or not. but I think that it wold [sic] be possible for me to wire to the bank and get what I need. Because I am sure that I can show the necessary identifications. If I had to I guess that I could go to the Red Cross and get it through there. I don't think that I will be needing any too much when I get back there though.

I suppose that Johnnie is having quite a time with his basketball games, I guess that he will play tennis when the time comes around. I guess  that I will be pretty bad at that when I get back there. Might as well try a few of those things though. I may even turn out to be a professional in one of those sports, you never can tell.

I suppose by this time that Wanda has found out whether or not she is going to like her new job. I think that it would be a pretty good deal if she can get anywhere in it. Does she think that she will stay with it any time? Guess that it is better than doing nothing, that is even if she doesn't like it. but I think that I would get something else to do, for myself.

Glad to hear that the box is on the way, I thought that you would have sent it long ago but guess that you were so uncertain about the whereabouts of me that you kind of hesitated a little. I am quite sure that I wont be home by the time that the box gets over here. that is if the thing ever does get here. I think that a lot of the boys have been expecting some boxes since before Christmas but they have never turned up. I hope that someone between here and there have had a mrery [sic] Christmas off someone else. I will be especially glad to get those T shirts. I have fianally [sic] gotten a few pair of shorts that will fit me. and that is something unusual in thish army.

Guess that Nancy sure must be something, the way that you talk about her. I don't know why she calls me the thing that she does but I guews [sic] that she gets it from somewhere.

I never did get the letter telling me about Ben and Mae being down to the Abilene place, you said that you were expecting them to move down there but that was the last I heard of it until I got your letter today. Guess that it is pretty nice having them that close to you, how long do you think that they will stay down there? What about the ranch, did they sell it or have they got some of the boys running it for them now? Wouldn't think that uncle Ben wold [sic] run off and leave it unless he had sold it but I guess that if some of the boys are there that he would leave it, I'll bet that he does not stay in abilent [sic] any too long though.

Better close for this time. write soon.           Love Always, O.L.
