Dearest Folks;

Well I hit the jackpot today, got 6 letters I was sure surprised to hear that Son was hope, the lucky - - -. Wish I could get out so soon but guess it is an impossibility, Four of those letters were from you, 1 from Wanda + 1 from Pauline. + from what you said you had been writing I don't believe I got near all of them.

Wanda was at Pauline when she wrote me + said she had been over to the skating rink, Guess it is just all in a days weather routine but it does seem awful queer.

I've got a couple of those "risins" [?] now, guess I should be home so you should tend them but think I would have to have a better excuse than that to put in for a discharge.

What does Son plan on doing now that he "is", or, soon will be out of the army? Does he think he will soon be running his grocery store? I don't think he will myself, but you never can tell. The candy was sure good, and, if you want to you can send some more, not much but just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Write soon. Love always, O.L.
