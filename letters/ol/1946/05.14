KARLSFELD ORDNANCE DEPOT
MUNICH, GERMANY

Dearest Folks:

Well, don't you think that it is about time I was writing a little letter for a change. I am on CQ while the rest of the company is going out to stand retreat so I may be able to get a few lines off before time to go eat chow. I haven't received a letter for so long that I don't even know what one would look like. Guess they are getting stopped somewhere but I sure wouldn't know where that is.

We are getting down to real army life now. We get up at 6;15 and stand revilee [sic] then in the afternoons we have to stand retreat and we are also having to have bedcheck now. That is besides all other things that they can think up in their spare time. I don't think that I will be over here very much longer to listen to all of it so guess I can't say too much.

We have the Germany PW's decorating up the area here a little and I think that it wont be so bad when they have finished with it. the red cross is beginning to look like a place to visit and the area altogether is looking a lot better.

I haven't been working too hard here lately, in fact this afternoon I took a little nap, about four hours which, I think has left me a little sleepy eyed. We had an inspection the other day here by a colonel from CBS and I have been doing a little more since than I was before. But since I don't think that I will be in the same spot I don't intend to overdo myself. Guess that is the way that all the other fellows feel about it too.

What is Wanda and her boy friend doing now? I don't think that they would have made any plans yet. At least I don't think that it would be the proper thing so early in life. Or maybe I see the thing at adifferent [sic] angle from the rest of them.

Joe and I went to Nurnberg the eighth to pick up some  things for the Troop Comm. and since then there has been a murder or two down there by some of the Germans. Guess that things will come to head sooner or later for them. there was a raaid expected here on this post by the Germans the other night and everyone was armed, but the most that we ever found out was that six armed Germans were picked up in the vicinity. Guess that someone must have exxagerated [sic] the tip the officials got.

We stil have our milkshakes and sandwiches over at the red cross but somehow I just can't seem to be able to gain any weight. The xxxxxx x chow that they feed us is not worth to feed to the dogs so I never have an appetite when I go over to eat and that could be the reason. I hope that it is a little better back in the states. I read in the Stars and Stripes today where they wre rationing food back there so I guess you aren't getting too much to eat. I think I could settle for about half what they feed us over here if it was cooked or seasoned. but I just can't down what they give to us.

Well guess that I had better close for this time. Maybe I can think of a little news to write next time. There isn't anything exciting that ever happens here so I don't have too much room to talk about the happenings.

Be good and write whenever you have the chance.

Love Always
