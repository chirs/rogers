Dearest Folks:

Guess it is about time that I was writing one more of these letters, I have lost practically all interest in this thing, it seems too much of a one way affair. I have still ben waiting for one measly letter to come in and I don't think that it is going to get here.

We have been having real bad weather here lately and I think that soon we are going to have to don our swimming suits to get around. It hasn't ceased reainin [sic] since last sunday [sic], unless it was just a little while so some of the water could run off, it is even worse than the wet weather back there. It still isn't cold but I think it is easier to catch cold in this weather than if it was colder.

We are still trying to pass the time just anyway that we can. Last night we got in a discussion and the conclusion of it is still keeping us wonder why, after water reaches 4 degrees centigrade, why does it start expanding again. I think that it has got us stumped. There are some of the fellows that have degrees in physics and so forth and they cant tell it to us. We also have general discussions concerning almost everything so I guess it isn't any too bad at that.

I had a little incident today that didn't turn out any too good. I was taking one of the trucks out of the company area and it so happened that there was a connection between the two buildings that I decided to go between I didn't notice but it was just low enough to catch on the top of the truck. When I emerged from under it I was setting out in the open and the rain was coming down to beat sixty. I had to stop and take out a couple of the ribs before I could go the rest of the way under it because if I went forward it would take the whole cover backwards and if I backed up it would push the thing through the windshill [sic]. Guess that everyday you learn something, that is the way with things, but you do emerge from the thing with a little more sence [sic] than you had before you went into it.

The Stars and Stripes this afternoon said that St Valentines day was only a week off and that we would have to hurry up if we were going to get our valentines home in time, but since we don't have any of those things over here I guess we will just have to wait until next year. Unless we had seen it in the paper we would have just skipped the thing completely, because there was no one that knew about it. I suppose that a lot of the hollidays [sic] will just creep up on us unexpected.

There should be something that is new here but I just can't think of it. I suppose that there will be quite a bit of new stuff coming from home if any of those letters ever get here. I should get a whole stack of them if they ever do get through. I don't see where they could be held up but they are bound to have stopped over somewhere for a rest and it is nowhere near here.

How is everyone getting along? I suppose that you are getting ready for the work or do you ever get a rest to do that? You should be having some garden stuff before too long. Almost everything that we get over here is dehyderated [sic] so you can imagine what a little of something fresh out of the garden would taste like to us. We did have some ham today for dinner and I ate my share of it. We usually have stew or something along that line so it doesn't pay to pass up a good meal when they do have one.

What are all the neighbors doing these days? I suppose that all the kids still go to their BYPU out there don't they? You should have some of those fish fries that they used to have, I guess it is a little early for that thing right now but as soon as this letter gets there it should be time. I would like to catch some of them for the purpose, even if I don't like to eat them too much.

Does C J bring you any of the squirrels around there to eat or does he even go hunting very much? He may even decide to turn mechanic on us, a couple of years experience in the ordnance [sic] shouldn't be any too bad. Don't think I would like anything like that though. 

Well guess I had better close for this time. Be good and write whenever you have time , I sure would like to hear from you.

Love always
          O.L.
