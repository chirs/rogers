July 6 - 1945
In Germany

Dearest Folks.

Well I got a letter from home yesterday so will answer it now.

It is 1:30 + the only reason I'm not out in the field is because me + 2 other guys get to go take showers this aft. We got out of playing baseball is all.

Say those fresh canned vegetables + fruit sure sound good. as usual we aren't getting chow worth feeding to the pigs.

I hope those insects don't do too much damage to the crop. Maye it will be a pretty good year.

Well I guess a job is what Wanda needs she should do good at it whether theres too much of a salary or not.

I guess Son's been having it pretty rough, maybe things will be a lot brighter soon tho.

No I didn't know of Alfred R. Rivas [?] of the 272. Write soon.

Love O.L.
