Dear Mom + all
I got your letter today + was sure glad to hear from home. But I suppose if you wait until you get my new address before you write again the mail will come through a lot quicker.This will be my last nite here but I think we will be in the states a little longer.

Those boys that were in my shipping order are so all scattered that I have seen only one since we left Camp Walters. He's that Vinson from Abilene + I will probably not be able to find him any more after we leave here.

I won't be able to tell you anymore about what I'm doing because our letters are going to be censored starting when we leave here.

Well today was a pretty warm day, just the same I have a sore throat that's bothering me pretty much maybe it's only because of my new GI hair cut.

The food up here is just a lot better than it was at Boot camp. You get treated a lot better too.

Did Don ever get his car out of Mineral Wells or is it still there?

How is everyone making out at home now? Has the check come in yet? I suppose I will be sending some money home now. They say you are allowed only enough stuff that it won't cost over $.50 a month.

Well I'd better close now. I'll write again when I get enough time.

Love O.L.
