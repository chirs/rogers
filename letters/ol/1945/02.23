My Darling Mom:

Another day has just about come to pass which draws me that much closer to home. I am patiently waiting.

Mom dear, I finally got your birthday present off. I hope you also have a happy birthday. I'll hope to be where I can celebrate our next one together.

I got a real long letter from Wanda with a few lines in it from you last night. It sure made me homesick for a while. I also got a letter from Pauline, however she didn't give me Son's address maybe she has sent it by now.

I'll sure be glad when one of those boxes of good old homemade candy arrives. Boy I could eat it all at once.

How's everybody at hoe? How does daddy feel since Spring is almost here?

Write when you can. Love O.L.
