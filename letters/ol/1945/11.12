Dearest Folks:

Well here it is the day after Armistice and I still am doing nothing. Guess that they will surely find something for me to do tomorrow. I think it would be a lot better than just setting around here and doing nothing.

This day sleeping is sure making a wreck out of me. When I do start to work I think that someone will have to use a few drastic measures to get me out of bed.

There has been a lot of snow around farther up north but so far we have missed it but I don't think for long. It is getting steadily colder here and the rain has let up for the time being, so I guess that spells something.

There was a great big pile of mail in today but I didn't even get one letter, I am getting to where I don't care too much if I get any or not because when I do I feel a lot better and when I don't, well I'm down in the dumps for a couple of days and I guess that it would jut be best not to get any at all. Or at least until I can start getting it regular

There isn't a thing around here for entertainment except the PX and there is hwere I spend most of my time. Since they have taken just about all my money in their poker games I think I will swear off it for a while.

I guess with old red's little calf that you are having plenty of good old fresh milk That's something that I havent' had since I have been over here. I think that is one reason why I haven't gained any more weight than I have. You know it always takes a lot of milk for the babies and I am no exception.

There is usually a dance about a mile or two out of town but since I can't dance I haven't been out there. I don't think that it would do much good if I were to go.

There is another fellow trying to write on this table and I know it is pretty hard to do with this typewriter banging so I think I will close for this time. 

Be sure to write whenever you can.

Love Always
