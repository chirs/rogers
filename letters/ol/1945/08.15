Dearest Folks,

Well I finally got some letters to be exact "4". I also got the pictures you sent. They weren't too clear but pretty good. I guess Virgil took the best picture of all.

We are waiting for word to come through whether Japan accepted the peace terms or not. I will probably be home by Xmas.  "If nothing goes wrong" if they do.

I have guard again tonite but that's about all the work we do. It's not bad unless it rains + it sure looks like that now. My shift is from 4 to 630 in the morn tho. Hope by the time you get this that the Japs are "Kaput" + Sons on his way home.

Love OL
