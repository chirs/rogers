Dearst Mom + All

Here it is only Sat. and it seems as if I've been up here for ages. I'm so homesick I don't know what to do. All I do is just sit around day after day thinking of home. I guess I'm just a homing pigeon at least when I do get back I'll sure settle down.

Mom I don't know whether or not I'll be able to get your birthday present off before March or not. I'd be satisfied if you'd send another big box of your homemade cookies + chocolate fudge you can also tell Pauline she could at least write if she didn't want to send a box.

Where's Son at now? I guess he went across just about as fast as I did didn't he? I still don't see why I couldn't have gone with im.

The only thing I'm waiting for now is the time when I'm going up the steps of home.

Love always
O.L.
