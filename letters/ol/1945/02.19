Somewhere In Germany

Dearest Folks.

Well I still haven't received a letter from home. However I still have hopes. I didn't write yesterday or the day before because I didn't have any paper. So I had to manage some to get this letter off.

I don't see why those damn Germans want more land for. The soil here is very rich + you've read of the deep pine forests with carpets of moss. With all the wild animals in it. Well this would be the spot if itweren't for the war passing through. I shot at a little deer this morning but being such a poor shot I missed it.

The weather here sure is fickle. It will be raining one hour + the next it's as bright + sunny as ever.

If you will mom you can send me the addresses of all the Kin folks. Aunt alfa, Buena + Uncle Bens + Sids. Tell all the kids out at Midway to write too.

How is everything at home now? I sure wish I was there helping you plant garden, maybe I'll get home in time to celebrate the 4th of July "I hope." 

I'll send you a bill of German money "I think it's out of date tho" + some french francs as souvenirs.

Write Soon.

All my Love
O.L.
