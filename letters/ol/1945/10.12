Dear Folks;

I guess I am going to have to stop writing again. Or maybe I am a little too anxious to get mail. I haven't gotten any today, what a pity.

Saturday night and nothing to do. I guess I'll have to start getting something to pass these nights away or I am apt to get a little disappointed in life. There isn't even any good magazines to read.

I suppose I'll be getting on guard before too many more days. They have taken just about all the guys out of the field and put them on guard but somehow I have managed to stay away from that so far. We have just about ran out of work out there for the time being tho and I will have to be doing something. I can't even stand doing nothing myself.

I wish that I were back there this minute I suppose that you are setting down to the noonday meal and there usually is something to look forward to on Saturdays isn't there. Even if it isn't anything but Sunday. It would still be a lot better than the Sundays over here.

Oh yes I don't suppose you will be sending any more of the V-mail over here will you? They are going to stop photographing it the end of this month. It doesn't eat the air mail either, if any the air mail gets here first.

How is everyone these days? Has Jo Wayne reached home yet? I guess he has quite a story to tell hasn't he? I don't think I would want to go through what he has been through. I know it wasn't an easy time.

What does Son think the outlook for him will be? If they are keeping up with the pace that they are discharging them over here with it won't be long before he is getting out. He should be home for Christmas. unless they slow down considerably.

Tonight is set aside to sign the payrool [sic] and I'd almost forgot about it. Some boys just went out to sing [sic] it. I'll have to take off pretty soon.

I put in for that money order today but I can only send home what I drew plut [sic] 10% I was intending to send more than that but that is all for this time. It will only be fifteen more days until I will be able to send some more.

Well I guess I'd better close for this time I'll write when I hear from you again So be sure to write.

Love Always
O.L.
