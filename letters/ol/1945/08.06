Dearest Folks

Today is supposed to be the big day. I think in a few more hours we may get our P.x. rations. We are really getting the raw end of the deal on them tho. They are a week late. Someone along the line will get their share '+ part of ours'

So Lou didn't like for you to give Sara Nell a shower well I'd tell him to kiss my big foot.

I hope you are having a little nicer weather now. We are trying to have a little shower this aft. It may clear off tho.

Guess I'll close now. Write whenever you're not too busy. Love Always
