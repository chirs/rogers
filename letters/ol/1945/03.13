March 13 - 45
Still In Germany

Dearest Folks,

Another day almost done. For one day the sun shone. It came out about noon + cleaned off, It was still clean where the sun went down so we may be having a little taste of Spring.

Boy we have been having it really easy for the last two or three days I just hope it lasts for a while.

Mother you asked about what Div + army I'm in well I know I am allowed to tell you the army + I think I am the Div. However I'm not sure. just the same if I'm not supposed to it won't get through. I'm in the 69th Div + we're in the 1st army. Which has been doing quite a bit of the work so far.

I got your letter saying you made my box of candy. I believe that was Johnnie's birthday you did that wasn't it? Boy that was a hell of a day for us. We moved out of our defensive positions + our Div. took 6 towns. I guess I never will forget it.

I'm sitting here eating on hard candy that we got [check] with our px rations + I'm racking my brain trying to think of something to write. We haven't been getting our rations regular but the last few days we've been getting what we didn't get before + I'm full just about all the time now.

Oh yes you said Corky had to take his wrist watch back because it was no good. Well I can say a bit more for mine I've not had a bit of trouble with mine + it keeps good time.

I sure wish I could see little Jo + Virgie now. What are they doing? I guess they're as mean as ever.

Take care of every thing as well as you can + I may be back to help you soon. 

Write when you can + make the letters long.

Love always
O.L.
