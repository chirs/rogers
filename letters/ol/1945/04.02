April 2 - 45
Germany

Dearest Folks,

Well I'll write QV - mail for a change. I sent a couple of cards yesterday + today but guess this will get there sooner.

The weather has been misty + cloudy for the last few days. Like those spells back home in [two words illegible]. It's pleasant until we have to get out in it for a long while.

Boy these Germans sure must wine + liquor drinkers you could never find so much beverages "Whisky" [?] back in the states. Some of this is just pretty strong too. If you get the stuff before it has worked too long you are able to down it ok.

Well I don't know any news except the everday things that happen right around here. I guess you know a heck of a lot more news than I do. I think the latest news is about the 28 + that's about the sum of it. Write often + when you send another package enclose some [illegible].

Love
OL

Dearest Mom + all,

Just another line today you will probably have quite a collection of these cards before I run out. Got a short letter from you today + it seemed as if Spring has really come back home.

Am still OK but it gets monotonous waiting for that package you sent. Keep writing. I'll drop a longer line when I have more time.

Love OL
