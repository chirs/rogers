Ft. Meade

Dear Mom + all

Well I have gotten a little time off for a change so I'll let you know where I'm at + all.

I got to Big Springs about 5:00 AM Fri. Morning + we stayed there all day + that nite + until about noon Sat. That was due to the foggy weather + the planes were all grounded. Well when we did get off the weather was so bad betwen Big Springs + here that we had to make a little detour. I passed over the house about 3:15 PM in one of those large C-47 transport planes. we sit [?] at Dallas for an hour or so + took off for Tallahassee Fla. It was so foggy there we could not light so we came back to Spence Field in Georgia + got about two hours sleep there. Sunday we left out again + landed in Washington at 5:00. We caught a truck from there + made the 19 miles into Ft. Meade.

I was up all night last nite going through a bunch of stuff "that was new years" and at 5:00 AM we finally got to land. They got us up at seven + we have been going like a bat out of Benlo [?] all day. So that brings me to where I am now.

The weather in Georgia was really nice it was just like summer + the country was really pretty too.

The weather here is not so cold. There was ice all over everything yesterday but its not near as cold as at home. I guess it would be a pretty good part of the country if the sunshine ever got down this far.

If you haven't heard yet, well I got my watch. Ora Mae signed up in her name so you will have to send her the money. the balance is $40.00 + you can pay as much as you can at one time but the minimum rate is $5.00 per month.

Did you get the proofs to my pictures yet? Are they any good? I guess you will have to send one of those to Mary Faye, Momma I promised her one + I don't know when I can get any more made. Her address is 1315 28th St Lubbock, Tex.

I guess Son got off OK didn't he? When you hear from + get his permanent address be sure + send it to me.

I don't suppose it will be much use to write me to the return address because I have already gotten my overseas stuff + will probably leave in a couple or three days for France or England. However you will receive a little card that will have my correct address after I leave here. It will get to you quicker than if you were wait for me to send the address to you.

Momma I know you have been worrying about me. Well you can stop it just right now because it is not going to do any good + you will only get yourself down.

Well I guess I don't have any more news so I'll close for now.

Love O.L.

P.S. Tell Virgie hello too.
