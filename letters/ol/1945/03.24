March 24 - 1945
In Germany

Dearest Mom,

It's been about 3 or four days since I've got a letter off to you so I guess I'd better write one today. Boy the weather sure has been nice the last few days you can really tell that Spring is here or at least for the time being.

Has been a couple of days since I've got any mail from you so I guess theres not much answering I can do.

I've not been feeling any too well the last week or so, my stomach has been upset + nearly everything I eat disagrees with me. I sure wish I was back where I could get some of your hot biscuits + a little of your home cooking. Boy a freezer of good old home made ice cream would hit the spot tehse warm days. Do you still fry those chicken back worms [??]? It's been so long since I've had tasted any real good cooked food that for a little I'd eat with the German civilians, only for the strict rules they lay down against fraternization.

I'll really be proud to get back to the good everyday life again. Some day I'm going to walk in on you to stay I hope.

Love always
O.L.
