Dearest Mother

Just a line to let you know I'm still alive + kickng. Can't tell you too much because of the limited time we have to get the letters in but will say a few words.

Have been living like one of those kings but don't know how long it will last. Have been drinking too much of that wine + cognac + have not been feeling so good today, guess I'll learn.

I got about 5 or six letters today, the first one that I've got from Son too. It was dated Jan 25. Got a couple of yours dated along the first of Feb + one from Mrs. Cook + one from Mary Faye. I still haven't got any of the packages you sent tho.

Got PX rations today consisting of Milky Ways. 4 of them boy they were really good. Have been hoping to take over one of those German drug stores with ice cream in it but haven't been doing hardly that good.

Am sure glad to get your letters telling about how the garden is coming along + all your plans it brings me a lot closer to home. I hope you can put some of that money to good advantage that I'm sending home. Maybe here is where your few hundred chickens including those friers will come in.

It's spring over here so the pink blossom on the peach trees sure do look pretty. The germans sure do take pains with their gardens. We will be seeing how good the stuff is that comes out of them before too long probably.

You have probably found out by now that my pen has just about gone all lousy [?]. It came unscrewed in my pocked + ben the point.

The time is passing pretty fast so guess I'd better close for this time.

Be sure + write every chance you get.

Requesting another box of some of that good old anything you want to send that you think I'd like.

Love always,
O.L.
