My Darling Mother

Well here it is another day coming to a close. I often think of home + of what all of you are doing at the specific time I am doing the thinking. how I do wish I was back there now helping you do these little chores I always liked to squirm out of. I would also like to be there to help you put the filling on that chocolate or pineapple cake + also sample as I go along. Mom, dear, I've never before known what an easy life I've had and what dram [dream?] folks I've had back home. I guess it takes something like this to make a guy realize + appreciate all those little things.

I'm getting a little more accustomed to things now so it's not so hard to bear it. I know in the near future I'll be seeing your lovely faces again.

I washed up today + feel almost like a stranger. you should have seen me.

How's the payment on my watch coming along. ok I hope.

I love all of you. O.L.
