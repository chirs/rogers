Dearest Mom + All

Here it is the sixth + I think I've wrote one letter this month so far. I guess you will really tell me off when you miss those letters I didn't write.

Wanda I was wondering what you were doing yesterday, I guess you feel quite a bit older now don't you. I guess you are having quite a time with all the doings now.

I'm still in the evacuation hospital but I feel as good as ever except there's a funny feeling still in my stomach however I just can't get enough to eat it seems.

The weather the last two or three days has been very uncertain. It rains almost every day but manages to clear off for a little while too.

Always an excuse, I'm writing on my cot + am in quite a position.

Will close now. Be good. Lots of Love O.L.
