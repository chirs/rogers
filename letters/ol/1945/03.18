Dearest Mom, Dad + all

Here it is Sunday Eve so I guess I'll have to write a few lines back home. I haven't got any letter from you the last two days but today I got one from Corky dated Feb 20th.

Well I washed my field jacket today, the first bath it's had since I left Camp Walters. I'm going to have to wash my waterproof pants too. The last time we dug in it was raining + muddy + we stayed out all night. We looked like drowned pigs that had been wallowing in the mud when we gout out the next morn.



[page missing? the remainder seems to correspond to the March 20 letter, so may need to re-order these.]



boxes I've asked for so you can just ignore about half of those if you want to, However I would like to recieve a few. Be sure to write every day because the mail situation over here is so balled up that I think I recieve about only half you write in the first place.

Well I don't know what to expect, hardly a Sunday rolls around but what we have chicken, I don't know where they get fresh chickens but I can imagine. Still it's not near like home. We haven't had any kind of pastries since we've been over. You miss those quite a bit.

I wish I was back there this Spring helping to get the crops + garden started growing from here it doesn't seem as tho it would be a bit of work. I might change my mind after a few weeks at it tho.

We got our PX rations about a couple of hours ago + I've already ate my candy bars. They are 1 oz each + not big enough to even nibble on so mine now last more than 30 minutes.

I guess that's about all for today. Maybe I can think of something else to say tomorrow so be good all of you + write when you can.

Love
O.L.

I wrote you a letter today + told you I had not received any mail in a couple of days + just as I finished it came 3 letters for me 2 from you + one from Jimmy Dale. He's getting back in the V-5 lucky devil.

You were telling me about Corkys visit + the homemade candy that you made. It sure made me think of old times, however I can stand it now easier than I could when I first came over, I know it's the same here [?] tho.

So cupid has still got his lasso on Corky + Wanda how he will Corky's as good a guy as you can find anywhere, that goes for all the Cooks. You sure won't find a better, nicer family than they.

Well Bailey I'm going to sit down + write you a letter some of these days. This is Sunday + all the Germans have on these nice creased [?] pants + coat to match. I just wonder what I'd look like in a suit again.

Love OL
