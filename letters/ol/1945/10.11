Dear Mom:

Since we have caught up on our work + I have my writing material out here I guess I'll have to write a few letters. If they get the water pump fixed tho I will have to quit + start to work.

This may look awful dusty but that is to be expected with as much dust flying around here as is. The vehicles sure do kick it up.

I got AV mail from you today. It took 4 more days to get here than the air mails that I got yest.

There were some more boys shipped out today but they only went to Kassel on D5. It's a wonder they didn't shove me over there.

I can hardly imagine having water melons at this time of year. As far as that goes tho I can't imagine having them. The peanut crop sounds a lot better than last years. I hope that you're not disappointed in it. 

I still can't feature Jo Ann going to school this year. She seems too little to me.

I tried to get one of those money orders today but they said I would have to wait until Sat. Since I've got 200.00 I'd like to get home but I don't suppose I can get all of it through.

You know the pistol I had don't you? Well I sold it for $50.00 today. I don't think I will have any use for one.

I'm glad to hear that you got my box on the way. But for gosh sakes don't send anything to eat. I can't even git rid of the candy I buy at the P.X.

I guess I'd better close + write a few more letters before they do start piling the work up for me.

Oh yes, did you get the $200.00 I sent home while I was in G. Co.? I haven't heard if you have or not.

Be good + keep writing

Love always
O.L.
