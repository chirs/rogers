Dearest Mom + All

Got a letter from you today dated Mar 2. So I guess they will start cmoing thru regular now.

This letter may not get there but I'll take the chance. You seemed awfully upset about Wanda, well I guess thats more or less natural in this younger generation however. I never did think that I did any of those things that seemed so foolish to me. Some do, some don't. I guess thats the situation. I hope ever things getting along now tho. 

I got a couple of cards from Amy + a letter from Edna yesterday + I'm going to have to answer those tonight too. On top of all that we've got beer + cake again tonight the second time since we've been over here.

I never can think of anything to say but sure do like to hear all you have to say about home just what happens everday. So be sure + write a long letter each day, I still haven't recieved that box you sent I guess it is traveling around the globe a couple or so times before I get it + my pants are still in the same fix as then.

Say mom did you ever get that money I sent you for your birthday - amt $60.00 There should be about $20.00 or more on its way now + next month there will be $40.50. Please let me know if any doesn't get there. You can do as you want to with it. If you need it for anything don't hesitate to use it. I get about $60.00 now besides my bond so I'll try to save most of it. 

Mother ever time you get a letter asking for a box you don't have to send it. I just get to thinking how something from home would hit the spot + when I look back on what all I've asked for it must be a good many
