Dearest Mom, Dad + All

Well I hit the jackpot today I got 21 letters, They were sent to mme at the hospital + are just now getting back. I'll probably get more the same way. I also got your box. The candy is all stuck ot the paper, "It probably had a pretty hot trip." But the cookies are ok. Mom, Since I'm getting enough to eat now you don't need to send any more packages until I tell you to. The only reason I asked for them when I did was because I was getting only about half enough to eat. I still don't get fed as good as in the hospital but I'll bet I get as much to eat as you do at home, It's not near as good tho.

I wouldn't worry too much about Son. A machine gun squad is pretty good to be in. The noly thing that's rougher with them is the enemy mortars. They try to concentrate on all automatic weapons. I'd rather he was there than in a rifle squad because he's always "or most always" in the rear a few yards. + you can't imagine how those yards help.

If I was you I wouldn't worry too much about me either. As for drinking I don't like any of the stuff. I'll taste it but that's all.

We've got a pretty fair deal here as long as it lasts. We never have to work, We pull guard + go on hikes etc. But I'm getting to the point where I wouldn't mind doing a little work.

That's aout all for today so I'll close.

Love always, O.L.

Since when do you spell plow "plough." So that's the latest form of spelling? Ha.
