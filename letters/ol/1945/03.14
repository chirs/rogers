Dear Mom,

Well it looks as if I'm forced to write you again today altho I don't know anything.

I wrote Wanda + Pauline a V-mail today + decided I had better write you too.

I've got your letters telling about my box of candy + my pictures. I'm glad the pictures were good + sure hope the candy hurries. There have been three or four boxes recieved by guys in our squad so far maybe min ewont take too long.

Today is really pretty the sun is shining bright + it's nice + cool outside. We have hopes of Spring setting in.

Take care of yourself + write when you can. I'll do the same.

Love always to all
O.L.
