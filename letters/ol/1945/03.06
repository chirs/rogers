Dearest mom + all

I finally received a letter. It was the first I have gotten since I left the States. I also got a letter from Choc [?]. He had been in the army for 4 hours, that was the first of Jan. Your card was dated the 4th.

I wish I had some news to tell but I don't even hear any myself. Only what I see with my own eyes. I told you in the letter yesterday that I saw a deer well I saw three of them this morning. "Only a bout a hundred or so yards away.

It sure is lonesome out here I don't know how I'll be when I get back home.

Write when you can.

Love always
O.L.

I've just gotten through eating what is supposed to be my noon meal. Altho it is 3:30. The meal consisted of those C rations that we used to hate so much when we were on bivouac. They really taste delicious these days tho.

This is my second letter to you today. I have nothing else to do so I thot [sic] I'd occupy a little time.

Mom since it is almost Johnnie's birthday you might be able to give him a little present out of the $60.00 I sent you. Maby [sic] $5.50 would do the trick wouldn't it? + while I'm at it, when is Wanda supposed to graduate?

Have you made any more improvements around home since I left? Wish I could send a lot of mon. home but a pvt. doesn't get too much unless he's really lucky with the gallopin dominoes.

My heart will always be with you.

Love O.L.
