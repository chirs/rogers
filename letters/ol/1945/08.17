Dearest Folks

Well we are definitely moving out tomorrow so there will be no need of writing to this address any more. There are rumors that we are ging to the 3rd Div. + also some about going to an ord. outfit. When I get to where I'm going tho I'll set down + write home.

The weather is still bad + I imagine it won't be too much for riding in the back of those trucks especially if they have no tops.

Love OL
