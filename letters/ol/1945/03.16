Still on Germany

Dearest Mother + All

Well I got a whole slug of those letters you wrote from Jan 12 on. I also got a letter from Wanda but what surprised me was the nice long letter from daddy too. However I'm glad to hear from all of you. I haven't recd. a letter from anyone except you all. Pauline, Pauline + one from Aunt Sister.

I'm glad to hear that that package is on the way. You can send one every time you are not too busy doing something else if you want to. I'm living the life of Riley right now but I don't suppose it will last very long. Last nite we had a couple of barrels of beer + 25 cases of cake for the company + we're still taking it pretty easy. However the last two sunndy days have sure made me homesick. The cloudy weather gives you a a "care for nothing" feeling + everythign can go to hell as far as you're concerned but the sun makes you think of home more. Be good + Send a package when you can.

Love OL

March 16, 1945
In Germany

Dearest Mom, Dad + all

No mail from home today but I guess I'd better write anyway. I think I got about six letters yesterday which should tide me for a little while. It was some of that back mail you were telling me about.

I think your idea is O.K. on getting a lot of chickens etc. + fixing up the east side. Get plent of chickens while you're at it tho. Maybe I'll be back in a few months to help you take care of things.

I sure made lots of mistakes that I can look back on now but there's no use crying over spilt milk so I'll try to make it up after I get out of the army. I never realized the position that you two were in or I might have woke up. I guess it takes something like what I'm going through to snap me out of it + make me see the light. However when I do get back I'm going to sure make up for lost time.

Well Wanda how are you and corky getting along now? I suppose you're still having competition from those Baird girls aren't you?

When does your graduation come off? I don't suppose there's much I could send you from over here unles I get a pass to some place back in France or Belgium + then its doubtful whether I could send something after I found it.

Mother you know that boy named Vinson don't you well you thot [sic] we may get established together somewhere. I was separated from him about a month + a half ago + haven't seen him since. I think he's in my division but I don't know where. I'd like to get Hogh [??] address if you can send it to me he's probably not too far from where I am right nonw.

Well Bailey I got a little letter from you + from the look of things you'd better get busy on that arithomatic [sic] hadn't you? You + Johnnie be sure + help mom + Daddy all you can + I'll promise you that you will be proud of yourself when you grow older.

But I still haven't got that Birthday card that Mother told you sent. Maybe some other Joe got it.

Joe you + Virgie are going to have to be real good cause I'm going to try to get Santa to let me come around with him next Xmas + I'll be sure to drop off at your house.

Mother you can send a box of stuff whenever you feel like it. We're so short on those delicasies [sic] such as candy, cookies or even a jar of home canned fruit or anything you think I'd like.

[over]

I'd sure be glad to get it. I should be getting that candy before too long but you never can tell when It'll get here.

Write as often as you can + make the letters all long + tell what all of you are doing.

Love always
O.L.
