Dear Mom:

Well here's another address. This one tho should be permanent while I'm over here. We're living in tents now, however it's better than any thing we've had to live in yet.

The weather here is not any too favorable here the mud is nearly up to the tops of our boots. The quick change in weather has gave me a pretty sore throat. The boil on my jaw has swollen up + it's pretty sore. Outside of that I'm as fine as ever. I don't know what I'm going to do with my appetite tho.

I still haven't recieved a letter. So write when you can.

Love O.L.
