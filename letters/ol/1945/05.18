Dearest Folks

Well another pleasant day is just about passed. There are clouds in the sky that may mean rain before morning tho. The weather, scenery + every thing over here is very similar to that back home. The trees are different but they are of a bright green + not like the pines. The green fields could very easily be some of those around home. Only a few bullet scars on the buildings around here is the only indication that hell was being raised around here less than a year ago.

The point system on discharges has been absorbing quite a bit of attention around here. About 25% or some where near that amount of the boys here have about enough points but I feel plretty unlucky with my few points. It looks as if I am going to have a steady paying job for a few more years.

I've got a big sty on my eye + it feels like a bee must have got me right in the eye. More little things are the matter with me. About a week ago I had a sore in my ear + it really hurt for 2 or 3 days. Now I've got the sty + also theres a little hard know right below my ear. It's sore too. So much for my troubles.

I am listening to a news Commentator between sentences + he is giving some pretty ood news on the war in the Pacific. The advances are paid for dearly tho.

Since all the American P.W.'s over here have been liberated have you heard any thing about Dan South? What about Lloyd Newton? + anymore that were supposed to be PW's or missing in German territory. What's the news on all the boys in the South Pacific. Have any of them been wounded or killed in action?

How is the home front coming along now? I suppose every thing is now in full swing. How many chickens did you finally get? What are the prospects for the garden, crops, etc. Did any of that hail storm come over home? I read about floods + some hail storms in the stars + stripes + wondered if it was in the vicinity.

You probably wouldn't know me now. you may not believe it but I have a spot of white hairs right in the middle up front on my head + ever once in a while you can see a stray one around the edge of my hair. My face is a little sharper + I guess I'm an inch or two taller. The only place I've gained weight is around my waist + in my legs. I wish I could walk in on you just the same. Jeeminy [?] already six pages + I've not told you anything yet. I guess I'll have to close + get a little news before I write again.

Love always
O.L.
