Dearest Folks:

The day after Valentine so guess I should get up enough energy to write home. I got a letter off yesterday and you should think I am doing pretty good to get another one started so soon. The mail hasn't come in today but I am sure that there will be none for me when it does. I got a couple the last three days and it would be next to a miracle to get another one so I have to bide my time.

The weather has turned into a fine mist today and it is very uncomfortable. I went down to the postoffice [sic] this morning and almost froze, guess the spring is being delayed here just a little. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't have snow after all, but it is a little late for it I think. 

Guess I will have to enclose a money order in this letter. I have forgotten it the last few times I have written and I have a couple of them in my pocket now and I sure do hate to send both of them in the same letter. There sure would be a good outlet for the black market here but since we can send home only what we draw there is no sence [sic] in doing any business.

I tried some of the candy in the box last night and it was quite a bit better than the candy bars that they issue us in the PX even if it was a little dry from the trip over here. I will have the underclothes worn out pretty soon I am thinking, because I will have them on all the time.

I am up in the personnel office typing this out because this typewriterr [sic] is a lot better than the one that we have down stairs. I would like to trade with them but they seem to like this too well to part with it. The fellow that works up here reminds me of chock but since he has had four years of college training it seems to make him a little more serious than what chock was. I gues the army will change him too.

I got my hair trimmed yesterday and I look a little funny with it sticking out, guess I will have to have a snapshot made and send it to you. Don't know whether I should or not though.

There is still no news from yesterday so guess I'll close for this time.
