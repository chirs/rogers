Dearest Folks

No. I didn't get a letter today but just thought I would sit down + write one, to catch up a little on the ones I got last week.

There's nothing new, Rumors to the effect that we will be leaving this organization soon but you can never tell about those things. Was hoping to be home by the fourth of July but it look [sic] a little far fetched from all official information we have received the last few days. I think it is pretty certain that they are going to stop all shipments from the LTO [?] during the month of June.

Have been having pretty nice weather here, "in between showers" Have had rain for the last 3 nights straight + it is pretty wet now. However its a lot of fun to take a spin in the jeep in all the mud.

Finally they've got Joe working. All of his records went up to Bn. last week + he's been laying around watching me work "can you imagine" until today + the colonel decided a good man was needed to write up the Battalion history for the first period of 46. So Joe was it. Have been giving him a pretty hard time about it but I don't suppose he worries.

Was glad to hear that you got the Mothers Day greeting I sent. Was afraid that it wouldn't get there on time + you didn't say in your letter whether it had or not but guess it wasn't too late.

I'm surely going to have to send a box home. I've been collecting so much stuff + have just neglected getting any of it sent that I'm sure I won't be able to take all of it when I leave here.

Hud [?] letter close for this time. Write when you can.

Love always
O.L.
