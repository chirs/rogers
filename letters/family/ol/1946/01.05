APO 584

Dearest Folks:

Well I am, I hope started on my last year over here. In a couple of more days it will be a whole year that I have been over here. It seems like about half my whole life.

I underlined my APO so you would notice that it had changed and the next letter that you write, be sure to put 584 on it instead of 758 because we changed Post Offices at the first of the year.

I haven't heard from you in the last week but I did get a couple of letters yesterday, one was from Ora Mae, A Christmas Card, and I got a letter from Louise dated the first of October to the 271 Inf. I guess that the rest of the mail is still between here and there.

We sent a lot of our men to Munich yesterday and are running pretty short of help, Yesterday when they brought the coal in I decided that I might just as well help unload it. I wasn't the only one though. Even the first Sergent [check] was out there.

I guess that I never will get that furlough to Switzerland, I think that I am still way down the list. I could go to France or England but I don't think that I would want to.

How is everyone coming along back there now? I hope that you are doing a little better than you were. Is any of you still in bed or have you been lucky enough to get all of them up?

CJ comes over pretty often doesn't he? I guess that he is doing quite a bit of trapping since he has gotten back there. What does he think that he will do from now on?

Yesterday I had to move out of the building that I was in but I only had to move about ten yards to the next one so it wasn't so bad. I was in a room with another fellow that went to Munich and the room wasn't anything to brag about so I guess that I didn't lost [check]  anything. All of the rooms are pretty cold but I guess that it is the weather here lately. It was down to 6 above yesterday and that is pretty cold for me. In comparison to what they do have over here I guess that it isn't anything out of the ordinary but I don't care too much about the cold weather. I think that the quick change is what gave me the cold that I have gotten now.

The sun has been shining for the last two days and I have gotten some of my pictures taken, I don't know when I can get them developed but I hope that itisn't [sic] too long. I think that I can give them to this interpeter [sic] that works here in the office and he can get them done for me in a lot less time than what I can get it done.

Don't tell Wanda but I think that she will sure be surprised when she gets the little package that I sent here yesterday. I would like to send a big box but I can't seem to find anything to fill it up.

Well I guess that I had better close for this time and try to write a little more the next time that I sit down to do this thing. Be good and be sure to write whenever you can find time from tending to the sick ones.

Love Always
O.L.
