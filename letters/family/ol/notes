The 69th Infantry Division arrived in England, 12 December 1944, where it continued its training. It landed in Le Havre, France, 24 January 1945, and moved to Belgium to relieve the 99th Division, 12 February, and hold defensive positions in the Siegfried Line. The Division went over to the attack, 27 February, capturing the high ridge east of Prether to facilitate use of the Hellenthal-Hollerath highway. In a rapid advance to the east, the 69th took Schmidtheim and Dahlem, 7 March. The period from 9 to 21 March was spent in mopping up activities and training. The Division resumed its forward movement to the west bank of the Rhine, crossing the river and capturing the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, 27 March. It relieved the 80th Division in Kassel, 5 April, seized Munden on the 8th and Weissenfels on the 14th against sharp opposition, and captured Leipzig, 19 April, following a fierce struggle within the city. Eilenburg fell, 23 April, and the east bank of the Mulde River was secured. Two days later, Division patrols in the area between the Elbe and the Mulde Rivers contacted Russian troops in the vicinity of Riesa and again at Torgau. Until VE-day the 69th patrolled and policed its area. Occupation duties were given to the Division until it left for home and inactivation 7 September.

"Action of the Fighting 69th in conjunction with the 11th Armored Division in the defense of Leipzig April 19, was the Divisions most famed action. One of the heroes of this action was S/Sgt. John J. Fitzgerald, of Chicago, a member of Task Force Zweibel. His gallantry and leadership at Leipsig won him the Silver Star. He was offered a battlefield commission, but declined. Pfc. Sam Woolf same task force, also won the Silver Star. On 25 April, 1945, the 69th made the war's first American unit contact with the Russians. A patrol climbed an old tower at Torgau, on the Elbe and sighted Russians across the river. Soon afterward came the link-up. During the following months, the 69th occupied Leipsig."
