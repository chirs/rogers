Dear Mom.

I got another one of those long delayed letters dated Jan 28th. I also got a little from Edna + 2 cards from Anye. All except yours were mailed since the first of March.

I just now got off guard so I'll now finish what I started.

I'm still doing all night + getting all I need to eat or at least enough. I might take a notion to volunteer for the occupational army over here if there's a chance, "There probably won't be.

You said you hadn't heard from Son in your letter maybe he thot [sic] the same thing that I did. That he probably wouldnt be there but for a few days I've got his old address "I guess" but I don't know whether to write him or not.

Be sure + send me a big box of good stuff.

Love always O.L.
