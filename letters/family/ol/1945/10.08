Dear Folks;

Guess that I will try to write a letter tonight. There isn't much to tell about but I guess that I should write ever so often. This is Sat. night and the barracks are all deserted just about it. I guess that the boys are all taking in a movie a beer joint or something on that order.

I still haven't gotten any mail and I have really given up hope of getting any. I may get a surprise some of these days though.

I am running a spray gun at work now and I put paint on parts of those halftracks that are out there. I guess there must be a thousand of them and we do only about a couple of dozen a day. It isn't quite so bad as that cosmoline was but it is still pretty dirty.

Has C.J. reached the states yet? I guess not but it will not be too long before he gets there. I guess that jaker will soon be there too he has been pretty lucky I think.

How is everything home now? I gess [sic] that it  s getting pretty cold around there isn't it? It is getting that way here pretty fast I think and it gets pretty cold here so I hear. 

We have a radio here and the "Old Barn Dance" is now on. We got the world sereis [sic] over it the other day and we get quite a bit of news and stuff from it. I see every show that comes by but still I have a lot of time that I don't know what to do with.
