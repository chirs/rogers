Dearest Folks,

Was sure glad to get mail from home today but the information on the clipping about me was a little wrong. You shouldn't have told anything but where I was + how long I've been over. I probably told you I was in hopes in getting 3 little stars + a presidential citation. Well I've only got 2 battle stars + we never did get the citation instead it was a streamer or something. I don't know exactly what it was.

Well I wonder how Son is coming along now. I'll bet hte rest in the hospital was not disappointing to him. I hope he stays there longer than I did tho. Maybe he won't have to go back up to the front quite so quick.

So it was raining cats + dogs in July. what do you know, maybe it was because they brought a fish home when they went fishing the fourth.

You said C.J. signed up for Army occupation for 1 year, I wish I could get the same choice I'd do the same.

I wish I knew what Hough's [?] adr. was his division is right next to ours we see a lot of guys with 3rd Div. patches pass by all the time.

Since we had today off about 6 of us boys went over to Rotenberg + went in swimming. Boy I'm really tired from it too.

Mother the last time I saw you I'm pretty sure you were very short on needles. So I'll send you some I have now.

Will close now.

Love O.L.
