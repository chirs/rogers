Dearest Mom + all

Since it is Sunday I guess I will have to write home, if I remember correctly this is Mothers Day too isn't it?

After a pause of about four hours or so I will now resume my letter writing. It is now 1000 PM + is just now getting dark. The weather has been real nice here but it seems to be getting pretty hot the last day or two.

Today I've been having a little trouble with my back. I guess it's my kidneys they were always giving me a little trouble but this is the first time they've been hurting since I got in the army.

There is a nut house right on the other side of the wall + the guys have really been raising cain today. It must be a pity the shape they are in.

Boy I'm sure growing a big tummy since I've been in the hospital. It's a pretty good rest tho from the front.

I guess now that there is no more danger for me at the present that you are doubly worried about Son. Well I'll tell you, since the first week I was up front I quit worrying. Altho I was still scare as could be. When the guy on your right + left go down + you don't you just have a feeling that you are following a path which is pointed out by another than yourself. So I guess there is the consolation that keeps chin up [check].

Well I've been about 30 minutes on this letter so I'd better start closing it up before they come around + put the lights out.

I hope to see you in a few months more but I don't have the slightest idea where I'll go when I get out of here. Write when you can.

Love always
          O.L.
