Dearest Darling Mom, Dad + all

It's been quite a few days since I've wrote but we've really been busy. Last night was the first good nights sleep I've had in "I don't know how long." Boy I really feel punk my eyes feel like they are just about to cave in. They have been hurting a little the last two days. They'll be OK tho.

I've been getting your mail right along + have also gotten a couple of packages. The candy + cookies with the nuts in them were a lot the etter, it also must have traveled faster, cause I got it about a couple of days after I did the other.

The country over here is all in bloom now + the pear apple + peach blossoms really are pretty. These people also have lots of flowers that are blooming out. The tulips make me think of the old fashioned Dutch windmills, I have seen a few of them around + they make the country look a lot more old fashioned. However it adds the finishing touch as in the paintings of these countries over here.

How is every thing back home now? I suppose it's getting quite warm by this time. I'm sure going to miss all of those good old homemade freezers of ice cream with a big cake soaked in banana cowning [?]

When did you last hear from Son? What's his address now? I've wrote one letter to him but I suppose his address is changed now. What's all the news on the rest of the boys back home? What's Corky doing now? 

How are all the crops coming along now? Did you have a very big garden? I guess it will be a good idea to buy a lot more chickens, at least there wont be too much hard work taking care of them.

How are all the neighbors now? How's the Tenner's + Wilson's feud coming along, regular hillbillies huh? I guess Carl still drives the bus, How's Mrs. Cook + her family, I'll have to write her before too long I guess.

Well I'll have to close. Be good + write often.

Love
O.L.
