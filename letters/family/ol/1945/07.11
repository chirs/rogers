Dear Mom Dad + all

Well I get four letters today 2 from you so I will have to answer them. It's the first mail I've got in about 5 or 6 days.

You said Son was in the hospital with yellow jaundice, that's quite a coincidence isn't it? What did he have to say about it?

Sure wish I could have been there on Virgie's birthday + that maybe it won't be too many years before I'll get to see home again tho. They'll probably think I should go over + knock a few Japs over before I'm entitle to a furlough. All Inf. troops that have seen action at all are supposed to get a furlough home first tho.

We had quite a day today, this morning we had a parade + this evening we saw a USO show besides the baseball, football + basketball.

That's bad about your sugar shortage I'd probably help to go down on what youd have quite a bit if I were to come home. maybe I should wait a while.

Wish I could tell you something about where I'm going and when but I don't even know [?]. 

Love to all,
OL
