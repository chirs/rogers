In Germany
June 6 1945

Dearest Folks

Well here I am in Germany again, just another stop at another depot + I still don't know where my outfit is. We were two + a half days in the box cars again.

Boy this part of Germany has sure felt the war, there's harly a building standing. You just can't imagine what a city looks like that's been bombed until you see it.

Coming from France I passed through Holland + Belgium + I saw some really pretty fields. There were flowers galore. There were also lots of orchards + in every gully was a little stream of water.

The weather has been pretty warm lately + this afternoon sure looks like rain. The thunder keeps reminding me of the artillery thats not there.

I stil don't know anything about my outfit but imagine I'll be put where they need me most + the quickest + am sure it won't be home.

Write when you can. I should have boloos [??] of mail when I do get any.

Love always
OL
