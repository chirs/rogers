Dearest Mom + All

I've gotten both of your boxes this last week + the candy + cookies were really good. That was pretty good about Joe + Virgil + Lynn getting into your pecans that you were to make candy out of.

You said you were feeling better in your letter. I hope you didn't have one of those headachy sick spells again, I sure hope all of you are doin fine now.

Yes I was in action the 28th of Feb. but I didn't know any boy from Texas in the outfit but alone [?] as close to home (Con Ratan) [?]. As far as me being in combat - well it doesn't do you any good to know that I'm going thru a battle + it sure doesn't do me any good to keep my memory refreshened on that sort of stuff.

I am getting your letters + the two packages OK so far. One of the packages was kind of deflated just a little but they both tasted real good. I'm still eating candy out of the last one.

I got a letter from Edwin yesterday + he's in the south Pacific now. I also hear from As?ye [?], Oma Mae + Mrs. Cook.

I'm not superstitious, or at least I wasn't but [two sentences illegible.]

Love OL
