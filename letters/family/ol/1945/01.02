Dear Mom + all

Well we're still here. We're getting all our stuff stamped. I'm on shipping orders now so I suppose I'll be on my way pretty soon.

Gosh it was cold today. The wind started to blowing + it wasn't even freezing. The sun came out + we got to see what things looked like in the light. There are maple trees + pine trees here + I suppose it is a pretty nice place in the summertime.

I haven't seen but about three or four boys from my company at Camp Walters. They're shipping so many men through here tho that it's pretty hard to find anyone.

They just got through interrupting me so I'm going to have to hurry to get a G.I. haircut before time to go to bed. I have just signed up for a $10.00 raise in pay. It will start when I'm on the sea. This will probably be my last letter for a few days now cause I get across after I leave here.

Were those pictures any good? Where's Son at now. Well I'll close for this time.

Love 
O.L.
