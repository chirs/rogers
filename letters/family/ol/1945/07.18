In Germany

Dearest Folks,

Well I just got through reading today's paper + it looks as tho we will invade Japan very soon. It sounds like they are really invading [?] the place.

Tonight is guard for me again, we don't get it so often here tho. We still have lots of room to gripe about the chow they feed us. However we are lucky that we aren't setting up in foxholes on the front lines eating C rations. "When we got them." 

Only a couple of more weeks + I should get paid. I'll probably send about $225.00 home if I get paid all at once.

Bye for this time. Write when you can. All of you.

Love always 
O.L.
