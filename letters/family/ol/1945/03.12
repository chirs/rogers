My Dearest Darling mom + all

Here it is another day + for a change the sun has come out for a little while. It's the first time since about the middle of Feb. that it has even showed its face.

This is the only kind of stationary that I have + it may reach home a little later than the other letters do but I'd rather write than not.

Boy I have really been feeling punk the last few days. I didn't even eat any breakfast this morning so you can imagine - me. I thot [sic] I was OK yesterday when they said were to have chicken for supper but it must not have helped me. 

The towns over here come quick as can be. They're probably older'n the hills tho. You very seldom see anything that we would call modern. I guess you could make quite a collection of antiques tho.

I sure could use a haircut now + also a bath. Altho I had a hot shower the 10th I feel as tho I hadn't ever seen any water for weeks. You get to where you don't much care. Especially if you're not feeling too good anyway.

How's everyone making out at home now? The more I sit around like I have been the last few days the more I wish I was back home. but I guess I'll just have to bear it.

I would write some more letters but we have almost too many now for the censor to take care of so you can tell Pauline she doesn't have to get a letter from me to write.

Be good + write when you can.

Love always
           O.L.
