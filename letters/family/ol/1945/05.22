Dearest Mom + all

Gee! the last days sure have been gloomy it's been raining pretty regular since last Sat. + this place sure gets you just laying around with nothing to do.

I haven't gotten any mail at this address + since I'll be leaving here soon, you might as well wait until I get a little better situated. The mail will probably catch up with me but there's no telling when. 

I got 1/3 of a weeks ration of ice cream today. One whole dip about a couple of ounces maybe. It tasted pretty good while it lasted tho.

I'm sure getting soft since I've been in here. I'm not half as physically fit as I was before I came into the army. It sure doesn't do you any good to only hike for exercise: you need a little work.

In about a couple of more weeks I may be able to tell you what I'm going to do since there is no more fighting over here. If I can get to the States I know I'll get a furlough "I hope" But getting there is what I'm worried about.

Love always
O.L.
