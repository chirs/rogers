August 25 - 45
Kassel, Germany

Dearest Folks:

Well here I am in an ord. outfit. You will probably read about the 69th + their big parade but I won't be there. I'll probably sweat a few more months out over here.

We are supposed to be working on trucks, but you can imagine about how much I know about one.

This isn't too bad here if they would give us some decent quarters to live in. We have better chow than we had back in the 69th.

My hopes of getting home by Xmas are Kaput. But I hope to see you before too many more years.

Love always
O.L.
