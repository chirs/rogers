Dearest Mom + Folks

I suppose that you are pretty anxious to hear from me. I just got some writing paper + envelopes this afternoon so I don't have any excuse not to write. 

Am in a general hospital now + dont' [check] have even one complaint. I think I told you I had the yellow jaundice, didn't I? The only ill effects I've had from it was for about 10 days I didn't have any appetite + there was a pain in my stomach but that's all.

We get more + better eats than we have since we've been over here. We get more sleep than we need. The only thing we don't like is when they come around + punch us with a needle. We have even got a radio in our ward.

The weather here is a lot nicer than it was in Germany, it's just like home. They don't have those old pine trees [?] every where either. At night too it sure looks funny to look out + see lights of cars + shining out of the windows.

You can write to my return address. I may not be here but there's always a chance of getting it.

I guess Wanda has just about completed her high school days hasn't she. I hope she has lots of luck in getting to go to college.

How is every one at home now? I hope that you are getting along as good as I am right now. I suppose that just about all the crops are planted by now. I hope you have a good season for it this time.

I guess with the war over over here it looks a lot brighter but still there's a lot of work to be done.

I don't know what they are going to do with me but I feel in my bones that my army career likes [check] quite a few more months being to its end. I hope I get out sooner than that tho.

When did you hear from Son last? Is he doing OK. What is he doing? Infantry or what? I heard they were in need of QM [?] pretty badly so he may now be in that.

Well I think I've wrote just about enough for this time. Be good + write real soon.

Love always
OL

My pen is kaput.
