Dearest Mom, Dad + All

Another cloudy day. The sun was out a little while this morning + it seemed a little better but these cloudy days here are like hell.

I am doing pretty fair considering. However I would give all I had to be back home with you. I have seen enough of this country over here.

I have some water on heating now I'll try to clean my face + neck up a little bit.

How is everything back home? Is it sunny there like it shuld be? Wanda how's school I suppose it won't be too long until your school will be out.

Please don't worry I'm doing O.K. I would like for you to send a package tho.

Love O.L.
