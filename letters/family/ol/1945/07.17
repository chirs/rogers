Dearest Folks

Well guess it's about time I was writing again. I got two letters from you the last two days + got one from Chock + Pauline yesterday.

Boy it's one of those hot days again + we've been playing pretty hard + I'm about to burn up right now.

If when you do send that package I asked for be sure to put in some stationary. I have to borrow some ever time I write + we can't get any in our P.X. Rations. I don't like to have to bum off someone else ever time I write a letter.

Guess what? The red cross came by for a change + served us hot coffee + donuts for about an hour or so. The sweat was just rolling off while we drank the hot coffee. I've also got a burnt tongue out of the deal.

What's the last news you've heard from Son? I guess he's back in there pitching by now. you said his squad leader is from Anson [?] Well mine is from San Antone. We've been keeping our fingers crossed about going to the South Pacific or not.

Doesn't Wanda ever have time to write me a letter or so I've got about 2 or 3 letters from her since I've been over here.

How is every thing coming along at home now? Boy I'll sure be glad to get back there again. I guess every thing looks about the same doesn't  it?

I can't think of a thing to say so since it's 10:30 PM I'll have to close.

Love to all

Write ever chance you get

Bye now
