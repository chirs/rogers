Dear Mom: 

I said yesterday in my letters that I would write every day if I had a chance so I'll drop a line or two.

The weather here is still cold as ever. The moon furnishes almost as much light at night as the sun does in day time. There's a big hill just south of us + the sun only shines over it about a couple of hours each day.

From all indications I'll be with the bunch that I'm with now but you can never tell. Most of the guys are OK but as usual there's some that are the black sheep. There's one boy here from Haskell + he said Coach Horton coached him in football. Otherwise there's not any other guys here that are from around home.

I got this weeks ration about a couple of hours ago + I've already ate all my candy. The cigars cost more than any thing else. The rations are real cheap tho. 

Well I'll close

Love O.L.
