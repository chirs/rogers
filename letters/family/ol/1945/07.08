Dear Mom Dad + Family

I got the big box [?] yesterday that you have been writing about. I've already took 2 of the aspirings out of the bottle.

Mother you don't need to send any more boxes of candy + stuff. but if you would put some hair oil, "vaseline" a comb or two, a double edge razor if you can find it a wrist watch band. I'd sure be glad to get it. We get our P.X. rations pretty regular now but they don't seem to have too much of those things.

It will be the end of this month before I get paid. Maybe I won't lose it in a poker game. "I'll send it home as soon as I get it. There should be about 225.00 coming.

Tell Wanda just because she's got a job she doesn't have to seem so stuck up. Write when you can.

Love always
O.L.
