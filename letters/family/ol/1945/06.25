Dear Mom, Dad + All

Well today I received 2 letters one from you + one from Pauline. They were both old ones tho.

It seems as tho you were having quite a busy time along then. I guess a lot of that is over by now though. Hope you got a lot of stuff put away. Sure wish I was back there to help you do away with the sweet milk + fresh eggs. We don't get a bit of milk ove here.

I hope by now you have got some showers that help the crop along. You need some of the rain that falls over here.

So Wanda got a scholarship to ACC Well I hope she does good with it. I would sure like to go to college but it doesn't look like much of a chance to. 

Daddy I hope you have lots of luck with the crops this year. Maybe I'll get a furlough home before so many more months + see how everything is. Well Virge you + Joe be good. Love to All,
OL
