June - 24 - 45
In Germany

Dearest folks,

Well this makes three days that I haven't heard from you. I guess the transportation is to blame.

I just got off guard at 6:00. That sure [?] I would get around [?] but I didn't. It was real hot this morning + about 2:0 oclock a cloud blew up + it really rained. It's still cloudy + showers all along. I went in swimming this morn + I've really got a sunburn now.

I got back from the show just before 2 started this letter + it wasn't worth a dime. I saw one day before yesterday "Circumstantial Evidence." It was pretty god.

We didn't move as was scheduled so I don't know when we will leave. I'd rather be over here tho than in the South Pacific.
