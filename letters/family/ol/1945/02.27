Dearest Folks

Here it is valentine day + I don't have any valentines to send. I'll write a letter to take the place of one tho.

The sun is out ever once in a while today, that is one thing we are thankful for. However I'm still shivering.

The birds are singing this morning, I sure don't see how that can happen in this god-forsaken place. I also saw a squirrel this morning. He was as red as a beet, there are a lot of queer things over here, or at least i consider it queer.

How are things at home? I wish I was sitting on the cabinet + sampling some of your cooking right now, mom.

Where's son at now? Is he attached to a permanent outfit yet?

I'm still waiting for a box of that chocolate fudge cookies.

Love O.L.
