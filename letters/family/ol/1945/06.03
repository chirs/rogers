June - 3 - 45
In France

Dearest Mom, Dad + all

Well Sunday morning + it's nice + warm for a change. It's only 7:30 + the church bells are already tolling. They only reason I'm up at 7:30 AM is because I've got a detail today + have to be there by 8:00. Boy I'm really getting lazy.

We went up to go to work + the guy didn't need us so we will get off today after all.

Last night the MP's made a raid on the black market out behind our tent in the woods + boy the French were running everywhere with MP's behind them. The black market gets pretty bad in places over here. The GI's sell anything they have + get quite a bit for it.

I should be getting back to the outfit pretty soon, Maybe I'll have more news when I do. Write when you can.

Love always, OL
