Dearest Mother, Dad + All

Well I guess I had better drop you another letter today. Yesterday I went to the eye clinic + he tested my eyes. He had to put some stuff in them for some reason + I was as blind as a bat the rest of the day. Everything was a blur.

My outfit is I.P.[?] bound right now + not via U.S. I am probably out of luck as far as getting to see home soon is concerned. However I can still hope until I know different. I'm afraid I can't stand too many of those battles like Iwo Jima, Mindanao + Okinawa without getting scratched. I hope Son isn't having to help take any of those spots. I'd rather take his place if he had to + let him off from that. After all he's still got a wife + 2 kids. Damn it all.

It's been rather chilly these last few days. the temperature has been around 50 + 60' + just laying around you get a little chilly.

I'm feeling fine now. I was hoping that "jaundice" would help me out of the service by a step or two but it wasn't bad enough.

Most all the guys in the ward are real "Joes" they've all been up on the front + most of them have been hit + they're not like a lot of these guys over here are "The rear eschylon [sic]"

My watch is still ticking as good as ever, it must be on the ball.

Will close now. So Bye. Gee Virg will be 4 soon won't she.

Love Always O.L.
