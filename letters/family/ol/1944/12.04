Dear mom + all

Well we are having a little time in the barracks after our first days of manuevers. We got in from Pinto Ridge + are supposed to leave for dry valley in about an hour or so. We spend 5 nites out there + come in again to get cleaned up then will leave for hells bottom to complete our maneuvers.

Boy it sure is cold when you have to get up about 4 o'clock in the morn. + put on cold shoes + wet socks. It looks like rain now but I hope it doesn't rain.

That's too bad about not getting the peanuts threshed early enough for Xmas money. Maybe you can yet tho.

I have only gotten your letter since I came back last weekend + Son gets at least one letter every day. So you will have to tell Wanda + tell her to tell Corky to write me + if we get enough time at the barracks next time I'll answer. Well I'm in a pretty big hurry so I'll close maybe you can read this if you can't just set it up out in thec chicken yard - maybe they can read hen scratch.

Love, OL

PS I'll let you have a little money for Xmas. I can't spare much tho cause we have to have a certain amount when we get our furlough.
