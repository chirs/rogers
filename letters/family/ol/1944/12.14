Dear Mom + all

Well I'm finally back from hell's Bottom gosh my feet are sore. Yes we had quite a few cool nights out there. I adopted a G.I. gut too. my belly has gained about 4 or 5 pounds since we first left out.

If we can we will be home next weekend but it looks as if KP will get us either Sat. or Sunday. I think we will be home Xmas if we're not we will be very soon after.

I sure got a nice package from Mrs. Cook today it was made up of walnuts, pecans + peanuts + candy it was sure good too.

Well I've got to answer a few letters that I got to close now + write some more.

Love,
O.L.
