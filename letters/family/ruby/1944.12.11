Dear O.L. - 

Won't have time to write a letter. Uncle Sid + Aunt Bessie came by last nite + just left. Been to Ft. Worth to a farm meeting.

Wanda took her clothes to stay this wk. with Pauline ot practice on their play. Guess you all have been plenty cool the last two days + nights. Never saw so much frost as we had this morning. Every leaf is covered as with snow. Guess the weather will be nice a while now that you are off maneuvers. Will try + write again tomorrow but we're going to try and paper some before Xmas. Love, Mom
