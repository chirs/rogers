Dearest O.L. - 

Am writing while I roll the cradle but made up my mind to write you at least once a wk. so better write today as this is Wed. Got the bond Mon. Have tried to save some of the other money you put in my purse just for you but have kept spending it, and have so little to show for it. Am still just dying to get some papering + painting done before Xmas. I wonder if I can. Think I'll just go ahead + get this paper + paint and put it on just as soon as I can. It will probably take a wk. to do a room.

Daddy worked all morning yesterday trying to start the car to go to town + couldn't. He took some parts to have them fixed + the battery to have charged. Mr. Parrish took him, so now the car is all torn up + no tellin when we can go to town. If I get a chance will send you a box rather than give it to you when you come cause you couldn't hide it very well on the way back to camp. Huh.

Hope you can come again Sat. be sure + tell me what you are hungry for. No news much, so bye for now. Love, Mother
